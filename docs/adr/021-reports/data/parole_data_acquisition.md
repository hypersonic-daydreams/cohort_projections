# Parole Data Acquisition Report for ADR-021

## Executive Summary

This report documents the availability of state-level parole data for humanitarian parole programs, with a focus on North Dakota. The external analysis suggests that post-2021 ND international migration includes significant parole cohorts (Afghans, Ukrainians) with temporary status. This investigation assesses whether direct data exists to validate these claims and identifies proxy approaches if direct data is unavailable.

**Key Finding**: State-level parole data is **not systematically published** by DHS/USCIS. However, proxy data sources and local news reports provide partial estimates for North Dakota.

## 3. CHNV (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) Parole

### Data Availability Status: LIMITED (National data only; no ND-specific data found)

### National Statistics
- **Total arrivals**: ~530,000 through CHNV program (as of Aug 2024)
  - Haiti: ~214,000
  - Venezuela: ~117,000
  - Cuba: ~111,000
  - Nicaragua: ~96,000
- **Program period**: 2022 (Venezuela) to 2023 (others) - January 2025 (ended)
- **Monthly cap**: 30,000 combined

### North Dakota Data
**No state-level CHNV data found for North Dakota.** Given ND's small Latino population and distance from typical CHNV settlement patterns (Florida, Texas), CHNV arrivals in ND are likely minimal.

### Data Access Challenges
- DHS does not publish state-level CHNV residence data
- Parolees are not tracked by residence location after arrival
- Beneficiaries can live anywhere in the U.S. regardless of sponsor location
- Only airport arrival data partially available (primarily Florida)

### Primary Sources
- [DHS CHNV Fact Sheet (July 2023)](https://www.dhs.gov/archive/news/2023/07/25/fact-sheet-data-first-six-months-parole-processes-cubans-haitians-nicaraguans-and)

## 5. Proxy Data Options

Since direct state-level parole data is unavailable, the following proxy approaches may help estimate parolee populations in North Dakota:

### Option 1: American Community Survey (ACS)
**Approach**: Use ACS foreign-born population data by place of birth

| Table | Description | Availability |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| S0502 | Selected Characteristics of Foreign-Born by Period of Entry | Annual, 1-year and 5-year |
| B05006 | Place of Birth for the Foreign-Born Population in the United States | State-level, country detail |
| PUMS | Public Use Microdata Sample | Individual records |

**Strengths**:
- State-level data by country of birth
- Period of entry helps identify recent arrivals

**Limitations**:
- Small sample sizes for ND (large margins of error)
- Does not distinguish immigration status
- Lag in data release (2023 data released in 2024)
- Cannot separate parolees from other visa categories

**Access**: https://data.census.gov or https://www.census.gov/topics/population/foreign-born/data/tables/acs-tables.html

### Option 2: Local Resettlement Agency Data
**Approach**: Contact Global Refuge (formerly LIRS) directly for ND-specific data

**Contact**:
- Global Refuge ND (Fargo Welcome Center)
- Dan Hannaher, ND Field Director for Global Refuge

**Strengths**:
- Direct knowledge of arrivals they serve
- May have more granular data than published reports

**Limitations**:
- Only covers clients they serve
- May not have comprehensive parolee data
- Private sponsorship arrivals may not be tracked

### Option 3: ND Office of Refugee Services
**Approach**: Request data from ND HHS Office of Refugee Services

**URL**: https://www.hhs.nd.gov/cfs/refugee-resettlement-program

**Strengths**:
- State-level oversight of resettlement services
- May track parolees receiving benefits

**Limitations**:
- Not all parolees access state services
- Data may not be publicly available

### Option 4: Local News/Media Analysis
**Approach**: Systematic review of local news sources for reported figures

**Sources already identified**:
- InForum (Fargo)
- North Dakota Monitor
- KFGO
- Bismarck Tribune
- News Coop ND
- KX News

**Strengths**:
- Often contains specific numbers from interviews
- Captures local context

**Limitations**:
- Estimates may vary between sources
- Not official statistics
- May become outdated

### Option 5: Migration Policy Institute State Profiles
**URL**: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/state-profiles/state/demographics/ND

**Strengths**:
- Curated ACS data
- Easy-to-access state profiles

**Limitations**:
- Based on ACS, same limitations apply

## 6. Summary: North Dakota Parole Estimates

Based on available evidence, estimated humanitarian parolee populations in North Dakota:

| Program | Estimated Count | Confidence | Time Period |
|---------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| OAW (Afghan) | 50-100 | Low | 2021-2023 |
| U4U (Ukrainian) | 600-800 | Medium | 2023-2025 |
| CHNV | Unknown (likely minimal) | Very Low | 2023-2025 |
| **Total estimated parolees** | **650-900** | Low-Medium | 2021-2025 |

**Note**: These estimates are derived from local news reports and are not official statistics. Actual numbers may differ significantly.

## 7. Recommendations for Data Acquisition Strategy

### Immediate Actions
1. **Download RPC state-level data**: Get "Refugee Arrivals by State and Nationality" PDFs for FY 2021-2024 from https://www.rpc.state.gov/archives/
2. **Access ACS PUMS data**: Pull Afghan and Ukrainian foreign-born by state for 2021-2023
3. **Contact Global Refuge ND**: Request ND-specific data on parolees served

### Medium-Term Actions
1. **FOIA request to DHS**: Request state-level OAW and U4U placement data
2. **Contact ND Office of Refugee Services**: Request administrative data on parolees receiving benefits
3. **Monitor policy changes**: Current administration changes may affect data availability

### For ADR-021 Analysis
Given data limitations, recommend:
- Use the **estimated range of 650-900 parolees** as a rough approximation
- Apply **high uncertainty bounds** in any projections
- Note that parolee status is **temporary** (2-year parole periods)
- Consider parolees as **separate from permanent international migration** in cohort modeling
- Document assumptions clearly given data quality issues
