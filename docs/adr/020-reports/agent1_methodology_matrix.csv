Primary data source for foreign-born immigration,Decennial census foreign-born counts and INS administrative records,American Community Survey Residence One Year Ago (ROYA) question,ACS ROYA plus DHS administrative data for humanitarian migrants,major,High - fundamentally different measurement approaches,census_wp51_2001; census_blog_2024_nim
Estimation technique,Residual method - subtracting known components from census foreign-born total,Direct measurement via survey question on residence abroad one year ago,ROYA method with 75% adjustment for humanitarian migrants using DHS data,major,High - residual vs. direct measurement creates different error structures,census_wp61_2001; census_blog_2024_nim
State-level allocation method,INS data on intended residence and decennial census patterns,3-year pooled ACS 1-year files for state demographic distributions,Same ACS-based distribution applied to DHS-adjusted national total,moderate,Medium - allocation methods evolved; 2024 may not capture humanitarian patterns,census_wp1_1992; census_blog_2024_nim
County-level allocation method,Census-based patterns,ACS 5-year files controlled to state totals,Same as Vintage 2020,minor,Low for county level if analyzing state aggregates,census_methodology_page
Foreign-born emigration estimation,Residual technique using consecutive census comparisons,Emigration rates by country of birth and tenure using ACS year of entry,Same as Vintage 2020,moderate,Medium - emigration estimates inherently uncertain,census_wp51_2001
Native-born international migration,Part of residual calculation,ACS-based estimates of natives moving abroad/returning,Same as Vintage 2020,minor,Low - small component,census_methodology_page
Puerto Rico migration,Adjusted residual survival method,ACS ROYA question,Airline Passenger Traffic (APT) data from BTS starting 2021,moderate,Medium for states with PR migration,census_story_covid_2021
Intercensal adjustment method,Das Gupta method distributing error of closure across decade,Same approach,Same approach,none,Low - mathematical adjustment is consistent,census_intercensal_2000_2010
Base population,2000 Census,2020 Census blended with Vintage 2020 estimates and 2020 DA,Same blended base as Vintage 2020,moderate,Medium - blended base different from pure census base,census_methodology_page
Timeliness of ACS data,Not applicable - ACS not fully implemented until 2005,1-2 year lag in ACS data,1-2 year lag plus administrative data supplement,minor,Low - lag is inherent to ACS method,census_blog_2024_nim
Coverage of recent immigrants,Captured in decennial census (with undercount),May be underrepresented in ACS sampling frame,Partially addressed by DHS adjustment for humanitarian migrants,moderate,Medium - coverage varies by period,census_blog_2024_nim
Humanitarian migrant capture,Counted in decennial census if present,May be underrepresented in ACS,Explicitly adjusted using DHS data,major,High for years 2021+ relative to earlier periods,census_blog_2024_nim
COVID-19 pandemic adjustment,Not applicable,Applied for April 2020 - June 2021 period,Incorporated in base estimates,moderate,Medium for 2020-2021 specifically,census_story_covid_2021
Uncertainty quantification,Limited - residual inherits component uncertainties,No explicit uncertainty published,No explicit uncertainty published for state level,major,High - cannot compare uncertainty across methods,census_wp97_2013
Vintage revision policy,Entire series revised with each new vintage,Entire series revised with each new vintage,Entire series revised with each new vintage,none,N/A - consistent policy,census_methodology_page
