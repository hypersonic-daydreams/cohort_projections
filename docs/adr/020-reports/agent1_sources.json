        "To develop the Vintage 2024 population estimates and to better reflect current trends and potentially underrepresented populations, the Census Bureau used newly available administrative data to adjust the usually survey-based estimates of foreign-born immigration.",
        "Data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is used to make an estimate of the immigration of humanitarian migrants. In recent years the size of this group has increased significantly, and the traditional data sources have not been able to keep up.",
        "The adjustment for humanitarian migrants was applied to the national total and then distributed down to states and counties using the Census Bureau's usual method.",
        "Since this adjustment was made to account for the under-sampling of humanitarian migrants in the ACS, this approach likely does not accurately reflect the distribution of these humanitarian migrants across states.",
        "Due to periodic methodological updates, such as this year's immigration adjustment, year-to-year comparisons in the estimates should only be done within the same vintage."
