Methodology Change at 2010,"Major shift from residual to ROYA method; well-documented by Census Bureau","Significant level shift detected (p=0.003, d=1.56); mean increased by 921 persons","N/A - not directly assessed",partial,"Methodology changed AND statistical shift detected, but cannot conclusively attribute shift to methodology vs. Bakken boom timing"
Methodology Change at 2020,"DHS adjustment introduced; 75% humanitarian migrant capture; +700K national revision","Non-significant level shift (p=0.13) due to COVID confound","N/A - not directly assessed",conflict,"Methodology changed significantly but statistical test cannot separate from COVID effect"
Census Bureau Guidance,"Explicitly warns against combining vintages for time series analysis","N/A - not assessed","N/A - not assessed",n/a,"Clear institutional guidance against combination, but research context may differ"
Small State Concerns,"Census acknowledges small states face additional accuracy challenges; rate instability","Very small samples (n=10,10,5) limit power; 29:1 variance ratio","ND pattern similar to other small states (SD, MT)",partial,"Small state effects acknowledged by Census and visible in statistical tests, but shared patterns across states suggest real regional effects"
Construct Comparability,"Three distinct methodological eras documented (2000s residual, 2010s ROYA, 2020s ROYA+DHS)","Variance heterogeneity significant (p=0.002); structural break test non-significant","Likely comparable (3/4 indicators positive); ND-US correlation unstable but may reflect Bakken boom",partial,"Mixed evidence - methodology differences are real but may not dominate over genuine demographic shifts"
NIM Uncertainty,"40% of DA variance despite 12% of population; most uncertain component","N/A - not assessed","93% agreement with ACS foreign-born changes validates general patterns",partial,"High inherent uncertainty in NIM, but patterns validated by external data"
Event Response,"N/A - not assessed","N/A - not assessed","Coherent response to 2008 crisis and Bakken boom; 380% growth 2010-2015",n/a,"Time series responds appropriately to known events, supporting construct validity"
Overall Recommendation,Proceed with caution,Proceed with caution; sensitivity analyses needed,Proceed with caution,full,"All three agents recommend caution; extension appears feasible with proper documentation"
