Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

2.2.2
Census Bureau Population Estimates Program

The U.S. Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program (PEP) provides annual estimates of pop-

ulation and components of change for states and counties. This analysis employs the vintage 2024

estimates covering 2010–2024, which decompose annual population change into births, deaths, do-

mestic migration, and international migration. The international migration component—designated

INTERNATIONALMIG in Census Bureau nomenclature—comprises the net flow of foreign-born indi-

viduals crossing U.S. borders plus the net movement of native-born citizens and military person-

nel abroad. For subnational units, the Census Bureau allocates national international migration

estimates to states using American Community Survey data on recent movers and foreign-born

population distributions.

The PEP data provide the primary dependent variable for time series analysis: annual net

international migration to North Dakota. Key advantages include consistent methodology across

years and comprehensive geographic coverage. Limitations include the composite nature of the

international migration variable, which aggregates heterogeneous streams (lawful permanent res-

idents, refugees, temporary workers, and unauthorized migrants) into a single measure, and the

allocation methodology, which may introduce smoothing artifacts at the state level.

2.2.3
Department of Homeland Security Lawful Permanent Resident Data

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publishes annual statistics on lawful permanent res-

ident (LPR) admissions by state of intended residence and country of birth. This analysis employs

fiscal year 2023 data, the most recent available at the time of analysis. The LPR data provide gran-

ular information on the country-of-origin composition of legal immigration flows, enabling gravity

model estimation and concentration analysis.

The principal advantage of DHS data lies in their administrative provenance: unlike survey-

based measures, LPR counts derive from visa issuance records and represent actual admissions

rather than estimates. Limitations include restriction to a single cross-section (precluding panel

analysis within this data source), exclusion of non-LPR categories (refugees, asylees, temporary

workers), and the distinction between state of intended residence at admission and actual destina-

tion after secondary migration.

2.2.4
American Community Survey Foreign-Born Population

The American Community Survey (ACS) provides annual estimates of foreign-born population

by place of birth for states and metropolitan areas.
This analysis employs five-year estimates

from 2009–2023, using the detailed country-of-birth tabulations (Table B05006). The foreign-born

stock data enable analysis of diaspora effects on new migration, origin-specific growth trajectories,

and Location Quotient calculations comparing North Dakota’s immigrant composition to national

patterns.

ACS data carry sampling uncertainty quantified through published margins of error. For small
