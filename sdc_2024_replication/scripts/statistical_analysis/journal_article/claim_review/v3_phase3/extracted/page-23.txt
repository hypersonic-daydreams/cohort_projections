Notes: Rolling-origin evaluation with expanding window; n = 8 one-step forecasts. MASE = Mean Absolute
Scaled Error (scaled by naive RW MAE; values <1 outperform naive baseline). Coverage refers to empirical
coverage of symmetric prediction intervals. MAPE is inflated by the near-zero 2020 observation; MASE
provides a more robust accuracy comparison.
†Oracle benchmark: Driver OLS with contemporaneous U.S. migration values, unavailable at forecast time.
The lagged driver—a feasible variant using prior-year U.S. migration—achieves MASE = 1.06, essentially
matching the naive baseline. No feasible model significantly outperforms random walk.

Structural Break Analysis

Structural break tests evaluate whether regression parameters remain stable across the observation

period or exhibit discrete shifts at specific dates. Table 8 reports Chow test results for three candi-

date break points corresponding to major policy events: the 2017 Travel Ban, the 2020 COVID-19

pandemic, and the 2021 post-pandemic recovery.

Notes: Chow test with df = (2, 11). Critical values: 3.98 (5%), 7.21 (1%). Regime shift indicates percentage
change in mean migration between pre- and post-break periods.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic represents a highly significant structural break (F = 16.01,

p < 0.001).
Mean international migration to North Dakota increased from 1,378 in the pre-

2020 period to 2,633 in the post-2020 period—a 91.1% increase.
However, this result requires

careful interpretation: the 2020 observation itself (30 migrants) represents partial-year data during

severe travel restrictions, while subsequent years (2021–2024) reflect both recovery and potentially

accelerated growth. The break thus captures a shift to a higher-volatility regime rather than a

simple level increase.

The 2021 break point similarly proves significant (F = 10.28, p = 0.003), with mean migration

increasing from 1,255 (2010–2020) to 3,284 (2021–2024)—a 161.6% change. This breakpoint more

cleanly separates the COVID-affected period from the subsequent recovery.
