Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

 Europe origin: HR = 1.568 (p = 0.004). European-origin waves similarly exhibit elevated

termination hazard.

The Cox model achieves a concordance index of 0.769, indicating good discriminative ability—

the model correctly ranks wave pairs by survival time 77% of the time. The proportional hazards

assumption is satisfied based on the global Schoenfeld residual test.

To connect duration estimates to forecasting, we translate the Cox model into year-ahead sur-

vival probabilities for any active wave. For a wave observed at age a, the conditional survival ratio

S(a + k | x)/S(a | x) yields the probability the wave persists k additional years, which we combine

with the empirically estimated lifecycle shape (initiation → peak → decline) to simulate wave con-

tributions within the Monte Carlo scenario engine. Figure 8 summarizes the survival curves that

anchor these persistence draws.

Forecast Scenarios

Scenario analysis translates analytical findings into forward-looking projections through 2045. Four

policy-indexed scenarios span the range of plausible trajectories, while Monte Carlo simulation

quantifies parametric uncertainty. Although the Driver OLS model achieves superior backtesting

accuracy (Table 7), it requires contemporaneous knowledge of national migration—information un-

available at forecast time. Long-term scenarios therefore employ the conservative ARIMA baseline,

which relies only on historical data and represents the best-performing feasible univariate method.

Table 13 summarizes 2045 projections under each scenario.

Notes: CBO = Congressional Budget Office elevated immigration scenario. PI = prediction interval from
1,000 Monte Carlo draws. CV2045 denotes the coefficient of variation of simulated 2045 outcomes (historical
CV is 82.5%). Baseline 2024 value = 5,126.

The four deterministic scenarios yield dramatically different endpoints. The CBO Full scenario

applies 10% above-ARIMA levels for 2025–2029 and then compounds at 8% annually, projecting

net international migration of 19,318 persons by 2045.
The Moderate scenario, applying 50%

dampening to historical trends, yields 7,048. The Pre-2020 Trend scenario anchors at the 2019 level

and extrapolates the 2010–2019 slope, projecting only 2,517—reflecting the modest pre-pandemic

growth rate of approximately 72 persons per year.
