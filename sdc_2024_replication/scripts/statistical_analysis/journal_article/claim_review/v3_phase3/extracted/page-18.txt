Quotients

Context for origin
composition assumptions;
validates concentration
patterns

All
(interpretation)

2.1 (ARIMA)
Baseline drift (ˆβ);
residual variance (ˆσ2)
ARIMA point forecasts
anchor Moderate and CBO
scenarios; variance feeds MC
simulation

2.2 (VAR)
AIC model weights;
FEVD proportions
Model averaging weights for
ensemble; not used for
standalone forecast

Model ensemble

3–4
(Panel/Robust)
State/year fixed
effects; covariate
elasticities

Validates ND position in
state distribution; informs
plausibility bounds

All (validation)

5 (Cross-
sectional)
Diaspora elasticity
(predictive)
Context for composition
stability; not directly in
forecast

None (context)

6 (ML)
Feature importance
rankings; cluster
membership

Auxiliary validation;
identifies ND peer states for
comparison

None (context)

7 (Policy)
DiD ATT bounds; ITS
level/trend shifts
Informs restrictive vs.
permissive scenario
multipliers; policy sensitivity

Pre-2020 Trend

8 (Duration)
Cox survival
probabilities; wave
lifecycle shape

Wave persistence draws for
MC; conditional survival by
intensity/region

MC simulation

9 (Scenarios)
Combined trajectory
paths; MC prediction
intervals

Final output
All

Notes: “Context” modules provide interpretive background but do not mechanically alter scenario trajec-
tories. “Forecasting input” modules contribute parameter estimates or distributional draws to the scenario
engine. MC = Monte Carlo.
