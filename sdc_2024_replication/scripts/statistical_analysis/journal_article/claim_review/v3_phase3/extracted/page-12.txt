Structural Break Tests

Structural break analysis employs three complementary approaches. The Chow test (Chow, 1960)

evaluates whether regression parameters differ across known candidate break points by comparing

residual sums of squares from restricted (single-regime) and unrestricted (regime-specific) models.

The CUSUM test (Brown et al., 1975) detects parameter instability through cumulative sums of

recursive residuals; departures from the zero line indicate structural change. For endogenous break

detection, the analysis employs the Bai and Perron (1998) procedure, which identifies multiple

break points by minimizing the sum of squared residuals across all possible segmentations:

( ˆT1, . . . , ˆTm) = arg

subject to minimum segment length constraints. Given the short time series available (n = 15), the

analysis sets the minimum segment length to 2 years, acknowledging the resulting power limitations.

2.4.4
Vector Autoregression

To examine dynamic interdependencies between North Dakota and national migration flows, the

analysis estimates a vector autoregression (VAR) of order p:

yt = c +

i=1
Aiyt−i + εt
(7)

where yt = (yND
t
, yUS
t
)′ contains North Dakota and national international migration, Ai are coeffi-

cient matrices, and εt is a vector white noise process. Lag order selection employs AIC, and Granger

causality tests evaluate directional predictive relationships. Forecast error variance decomposition

quantifies the contribution of each variable to forecast uncertainty at various horizons.

Panel Data Methods

Panel data analysis exploits variation across states and time to estimate relationships unidentifiable

from single-state time series.
The analysis employs state-year observations spanning 51 states

(including the District of Columbia) over 15 years (2010–2024), yielding 765 observations.

The fixed effects model specifies:

yit = αi + λt + x′
itβ + εit
(8)

where yit denotes international migration to state i in year t, αi represents state-specific inter-

cepts absorbing time-invariant heterogeneity, λt captures common year effects, and xit contains
