Figure 9: Projection scenarios for North Dakota international migration, 2025–2045. Four sce-
narios are shown: CBO Full (2025–2029 at 1.1× ARIMA, then 8% annual growth), Moderate
(dampened historical trend), Zero (counterfactual with no international migration), and Pre-2020
Trend (anchored to 2019 with the 2010–2019 slope). Shaded bands represent 50% and 95% predic-
tion intervals from 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Historical data (2010–2024) shown with black
circles. The vertical dashed line separates historical observations from projections.
