Cross-Sectional Allocation Model Estimates

Cross-sectional allocation models estimated via Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) quan-

tify the relationship between LPR admissions and diaspora stocks. As noted in Section 2.6, these

models differ from traditional gravity specifications in that they omit origin–destination distance,

which varies minimally across U.S. states for a given origin country. Table 9 reports coefficient

estimates across three specifications of increasing complexity.

Notes: Two-way clustered standard errors (state and origin) in parentheses. PPML estimation. * p < 0.05;
*** p < 0.001. Dependent variable: LPR admissions by state-country pair, FY 2023. Distance is omitted
because within-U.S. variation in origin–state distance is minimal (see Section 2.6). State FE specification
includes 50 state dummy variables (coefficients not reported).

The simple specification yields a diaspora association of 0.448 (SE = 0.104, p < 0.001), indi-

cating that larger state–origin stocks are correlated with higher FY2023 admissions. However, this

bivariate model omits origin and destination scale.

The full model adds origin and destination foreign-born totals. With two-way clustered SEs,

the diaspora association attenuates to 0.140 (SE = 0.248, p = 0.57), while state foreign-born totals

remain the dominant predictor (elasticity = 0.792, SE = 0.212, p < 0.001).
The origin stock

coefficient is small and imprecise (0.046, SE = 0.192).

The state fixed effects specification yields a diaspora association of 0.163 (SE = 0.148, p = 0.27).

This estimate remains below the simple model and underscores the sensitivity of cross-sectional

coefficients to controls and inference.

The attenuation from 0.45 to approximately 0.14 has practical implications for forecasting.

Much of the simple-model association reflects selection of large receiving states with both large

diaspora stocks and continued large flows.
The pseudo-R2 values indicate that the full model

explains 40% of deviance, roughly double the explanatory power of the bivariate specification.

Because FY2023 is a single cross-section, these results are interpreted as predictive diaspora–

flow associations rather than causal diaspora effects. We report two-way clustered SEs to account

for correlation within origins and destinations, and note that ACS diaspora stocks are estimates
