Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
2

Monte Carlo scenario projections through 2045 yield a median net international

migration forecast of 9,056 persons with a 95% prediction interval spanning 3,570 to

14,491—a factor of 4.1—honestly characterizing the structural uncertainty inherent in

small-state migration forecasting. This wide interval has direct implications for demo-

graphic planning: agencies must develop contingent capacity strategies rather than rely-

ing on misleadingly precise point forecasts. The multi-method framework demonstrates

that rigorous demographic analysis remains feasible even when small populations strain

conventional asymptotic methods, provided analysts attend carefully to identification

assumptions and uncertainty quantification.
