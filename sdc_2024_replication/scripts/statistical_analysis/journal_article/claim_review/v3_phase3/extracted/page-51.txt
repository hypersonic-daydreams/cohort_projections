Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

Appendix

A
Full Regression Tables

This appendix presents complete regression output for all specifications discussed in the main text,

including coefficient estimates, standard errors, and diagnostic statistics.

A.1
Panel Data Models

Table 14 reports the full panel regression results comparing pooled OLS, fixed effects, and random

effects specifications for state-level international migration.

A.2
Cross-Sectional Allocation Model Specifications

Table 15 presents the complete cross-sectional allocation model estimates across the PPML spec-

ifications discussed in Section 3.6. As noted in Section 2.6, these models omit origin–destination

distance because variation in distance from a given origin country to different U.S. states is minimal.

A.3
Difference-in-Differences Specifications

Table 16 reports the complete difference-in-differences estimates for the Travel Ban analysis, in-

cluding alternative specifications and robustness checks.

B
Robustness Checks

This section summarizes robustness checks for the main empirical findings.

B.1
Alternative Unit Root Tests

Table 17 reports unit root test results using alternative specifications and a break-robust test,

providing sensitivity checks for North Dakota international migration.

B.2
Alternative Structural Break Tests

The Bai-Perron procedure for endogenous break detection yields the following results under alter-

native information criteria:

 BIC criterion: 0 breaks detected (penalty on parameters dominates)

 AIC criterion: 1 break detected at 2020 (F = 14.23, p < 0.001)

 Sequential procedure: 2 breaks detected at 2017 and 2020 (marginal significance at 2017)
