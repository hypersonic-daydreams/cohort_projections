Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

quantify relationships; and causal inference methods identify policy effects. Together, these ap-

proaches enable triangulation across analytical frameworks, enhancing confidence in findings that

emerge consistently while flagging conclusions dependent on particular modeling assumptions.

2.1
Analytical Pipeline Overview

Figure 1 summarizes the nine-module pipeline and the flow of information into the scenario en-

gine. Modules 1–6 provide descriptive diagnostics, baseline time-series structure, and predictive

covariates. Module 7 offers causal evidence of policy sensitivity, which informs the narrative inter-

pretation of scenarios but does not replace the forecast target. Module 8 translates refugee wave

persistence into a forecasting adjustment, and Module 9 integrates all inputs into scenario paths

and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

Data Sources

The analysis draws on four primary data sources, each capturing distinct dimensions of international

migration to North Dakota. We define a single forecasting estimand based on the Census Bureau

Population Estimates Program (PEP) net international migration component for North Dakota,

and treat all other sources as auxiliary inputs for decomposition, prediction, and validation. Table 2

maps each source to its measurement properties (flow versus stock; net versus gross; time basis)

and its role relative to the forecast target.
