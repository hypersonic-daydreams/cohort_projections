time-varying covariates. The random effects model treats αi as random draws from a population

distribution rather than fixed parameters to be estimated.

Model selection between fixed and random effects employs the Hausman test (Hausman, 1978),

which evaluates whether random effects estimates exhibit bias due to correlation between αi and

regressors.
Under the null hypothesis of no correlation, random effects is efficient; under the

alternative, fixed effects is consistent but random effects is biased.
The test statistic follows a

chi-squared distribution under the null:

H = (ˆβFE − ˆβRE)′[Var(ˆβFE) − Var(ˆβRE)]−1(ˆβFE − ˆβRE) ∼ χ2

Standard errors are clustered at the state level to account for within-state serial correlation.

Cross-Sectional Allocation Models

Cross-sectional allocation models quantify how LPR admissions are distributed across state–origin

pairs as a function of diaspora stocks and destination characteristics. Although inspired by the

gravity framework (Tinbergen, 1962; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003), our specification differs

in two respects: (1) it uses a single FY2023 cross-section rather than bilateral panel data, and (2)

it omits origin–destination distance because our destination units are U.S. states receiving flows

from the same origin countries—variation in distance to a given origin is minimal and dominated

by within-U.S. allocation patterns rather than international migration costs.2

The analysis estimates specifications using the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML)

estimator advocated by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), which addresses two limitations of log-

linear OLS: heteroskedasticity-induced bias and the inability to accommodate zero flows.

The estimated specification takes the form:

E[Mod] = exp(β0 + β1 ln Stockod + β2 ln OriginTotalo + β3 ln DestTotald + γ′Zod)
(10)

where Mod denotes LPR admissions from origin country o to destination state d (FY2023), Stockod
is the existing diaspora (foreign-born from o residing in d), OriginTotalo is the national foreign-

born population from origin o, DestTotald is the total foreign-born population in destination state

d, and Zod contains additional bilateral controls. The coefficient β1 on diaspora stock captures a

cross-sectional diaspora–flow association useful for prediction.

Diaspora elasticity estimation acknowledges endogeneity concerns: diaspora stocks and migra-

tion flows are jointly determined, and historical flows mechanically generate stocks. The analysis

therefore frames coefficients as predictive associations rather than causal effects; robustness checks

consider lagged stock measures and historical settlement patterns (Card, 2001).

2Traditional gravity models estimate distance effects using cross-country bilateral flows where distance proxies
transaction costs. In our state-level allocation context, the relevant “distance” would be origin–state distance, which
is nearly constant across states for a given origin (e.g., distance from Nepal to North Dakota versus to Minnesota
differs by less than 2%). We therefore focus on diaspora networks and destination scale as the primary allocation
mechanisms.
