Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
31

Monte Carlo simulation propagates parameter uncertainty through the projection model. Based

on 1,000 draws from estimated trend and volatility distributions (CV2045 = 0.38), the median 2045

projection is 9,056 persons, with a 50% prediction interval of [6,450, 11,292] and a 95% prediction

interval of [3,570, 14,491]. The latter interval spans a factor of 4.1, reflecting substantial irreducible

uncertainty over a 20-year horizon given the observed volatility and structural instability. The

simulation CV refers to dispersion in projected 2045 outcomes and is not directly comparable to

the historical CV of annual observations.

Model averaging weights alternative time series specifications by AIC. The VAR model receives

effectively all AIC weight (1.000) relative to the univariate ARIMA (weight ≈ 0), reflecting the

superior fit of the multivariate specification. For cross-sectional models, Random Forest receives

the highest R2-based weight (0.462), followed by Elastic Net (0.293) and OLS (0.245).

Role of Machine Learning Methods.
The ML methods described in Section 2.7 serve an aux-

iliary role in this analysis rather than contributing directly to the scenario trajectories. Elastic Net

regularization (R2
CV = 0.60) identifies three non-zero predictors of state-level international migra-

tion share: log population (coefficient = 0.015), natural change (0.011), and birth rate (−0.003).

Random Forest (R2
CV = 0.94) confirms that log population dominates feature importance (93%

of relative importance), with death rate and domestic migration rate contributing marginally. K-

means clustering (K = 2; silhouette = 0.64) places North Dakota in the larger cluster containing

52 states, with only one state forming a distinct cluster.

These ML results provide three contributions to the broader analysis: (1) they validate that

population scale is the primary determinant of state-level migration allocation, consistent with the

cross-sectional models in Section 3.6; (2) they identify peer states for North Dakota (the 51 states in

its cluster) useful for comparative benchmarking; and (3) they confirm that no parsimonious feature

set substantially improves upon simple population-based allocation models. Because ML methods

are trained on cross-sectional variation and do not generate time-series forecasts, they do not

directly parameterize the scenario engine. Full ML diagnostics are available in the supplementary

materials.

certainty bands, illustrating both the range of policy-contingent outcomes and the widening uncer-

tainty envelope over the projection horizon.

Discussion

This study set out to characterize international migration to North Dakota—a small state operat-

ing at the demographic margins of American immigration—and to develop a rigorous framework

for forecasting these flows under uncertainty. The multi-method analysis yielded convergent find-

ings across nine analytical modules, while also revealing the inherent limits of prediction in this

domain. This section interprets the key findings in relation to the research questions posed in the
