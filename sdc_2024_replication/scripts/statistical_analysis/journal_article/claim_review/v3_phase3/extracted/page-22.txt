Notes: ADF = Augmented Dickey-Fuller test statistic. Lag selection by AIC. n = 15 annual observations.

ARIMA model selection via AIC identifies ARIMA(0,1,0) as a candidate baseline specification

in this very small sample. The random-walk baseline implies that the best one-step forecast equals

the most recent observation, with innovations representing unpredictable shocks. Diagnostic tests

support adequacy within the limited sample: the Ljung-Box portmanteau test finds no significant

residual autocorrelation through lag 5 (Q = 4.12, p = 0.404), and residuals pass the Shapiro-Wilk

normality test (W = 0.968, p = 0.820).

The random-walk baseline implies substantial forecast uncertainty. Five-year-ahead prediction

intervals widen dramatically: the 2029 forecast of 5,126 migrants carries a 95% prediction interval

of [212, 10,040], spanning nearly two orders of magnitude.
This uncertainty reflects both the

inherent unpredictability of migration processes and the limited sample size constraining parameter

precision.

Rolling-origin backtesting (expanding window, 2010–2016 start; 2017–2024 forecasts) bench-

marks point accuracy and interval calibration. Table 7 reports Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)

alongside conventional metrics; MASE is robust to the near-zero 2020 observation that inflates

MAPE. The driver regression using contemporaneous U.S. migration—an “oracle” benchmark that

assumes knowledge of future national flows—achieves the lowest MAE/RMSE and MASE = 0.27.

However, this model is infeasible for real-time forecasting. A feasible variant using lagged (prior-

year) U.S. migration achieves MASE = 1.06, essentially matching the naive baseline. Among all

feasible methods, the naive random-walk and ARIMA(0,1,0) perform identically (MASE = 1.00),

with no feasible model significantly outperforming the random walk. Interval widths remain large

across models; these results are therefore descriptive rather than definitive.

Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots for the dif-

ferenced series (Figure 4) confirm the absence of significant serial correlation at standard lags,

consistent with the random-walk baseline.

3Statsmodels reports KPSS p-values as 0.10 when p ≥ 0.10; values shown as 0.10 should be read as upper bounds.
