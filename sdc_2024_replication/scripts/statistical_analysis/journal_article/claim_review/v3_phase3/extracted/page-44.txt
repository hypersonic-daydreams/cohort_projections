Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
44

From a policy perspective, investments in community development, ethnic organization ca-

pacity, and integration infrastructure may strengthen diaspora associations over time, potentially

increasing the predictability and sustainability of migration flows. Mossaad et al. (2020) document

that secondary migration of refugees responds to community presence and opportunity; building

stronger communities in North Dakota may reduce out-migration to larger metropolitan areas while

attracting secondary migrants from initial resettlement locations elsewhere.

Workforce Development Implications

For Great Plains states facing persistent labor shortages in agriculture, food processing, and health-

care, international migration represents a critical workforce pipeline (Albrecht, 1993; Winders,

2022). The duration analysis finding that higher-intensity immigration waves persist longer sug-

gests that substantial initial investments in resettlement capacity may yield extended returns as

refugee communities become established and self-sustaining.

The concentration of North Dakota’s foreign-born population in working-age cohorts—a com-

mon pattern for recent arrivals—implies that international migration contributes to labor force

growth even when overall population growth remains modest. Workforce development strategies

that integrate newly arrived populations, address credential recognition barriers, and support En-

glish language acquisition can amplify these demographic contributions.

Limitations and Caveats

Several limitations warrant explicit acknowledgment. First, the time series analysis operates with

a sample of only 15 annual observations (2010–2024), constraining the power of unit root tests,

structural break detection, and long-horizon forecasting. The ADF test’s failure to reject the unit

root null should be interpreted cautiously—limited power means that trend-stationary alternatives

cannot be confidently excluded. The wide prediction intervals honestly reflect this sample limitation

but may overstate uncertainty relative to what longer series would support.

Second, the refugee arrival data that support the causal inference and duration analyses end in

fiscal year 2020, precluding examination of post-COVID recovery patterns in this specific migration

category. The analysis can characterize pre-pandemic refugee dynamics and estimate Travel Ban

effects but cannot assess whether recent policy changes have altered these relationships.

Third, the difference-in-differences identification strategy assumes that absent the Travel Ban,

refugee arrivals from affected and unaffected countries would have followed parallel trajectories.

The linear pre-trend test does not reject this assumption (p = 0.334), but the event study joint

pre-treatment test rejects when the full pre-period is included (p < 0.001), signaling longer-run

divergence that could reflect shifting conflict dynamics across origin countries.

Fourth, the synthetic comparator for North Dakota is descriptive rather than causal because

the Travel Ban is a national shock. The donor-weighted benchmark (RMSPE = 0.020) may still

reflect unobserved similarities among small states, so post-2017 deviations should be interpreted as

descriptive patterns rather than counterfactual policy effects.
