Causal Inference Findings

Causal inference results focus on difference-in-differences for the Travel Ban and an interrupted

time series for COVID-19. A synthetic comparator is reported as a descriptive benchmark, and a

shift-share index provides first-stage relevance for refugee-driven shocks.

3.7.1
Travel Ban Difference-in-Differences

The Travel Ban analysis employs refugee arrival data spanning 2002–2019, with 2018 designated as

the first full post-treatment year. The treatment group comprises seven affected nationalities (Iran,

Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen), while 119 unaffected nationalities serve as controls.

The sample includes 1,137 nationality-year observations.

The estimated average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is −1.384 on the log scale (t =

−2.14, p = 0.032), corresponding to a policy-associated divergence of 74.9% in refugee arrivals

from affected countries. The 95% confidence interval [−2.65, −0.12] excludes zero, indicating a

statistically significant and economically substantial short-run divergence.

Parallel trends diagnostics are mixed, requiring caution in causal interpretation. The linear pre-

trend test yields a treated-country trend coefficient of 0.087 (t = 0.97, p = 0.334), but the event

study’s joint pre-treatment test rejects parallel trends over the full pre-period (F = 4.31, p < 0.001).

Figure 7 shows divergence beginning approximately 10 years before treatment, indicating that the

treatment and control groups were on different trajectories prior to the policy. The immediate

post-treatment coefficients shift sharply negative in 2018–2019, but because the parallel trends

assumption is violated, the estimated effect conflates the policy impact with pre-existing divergence.

We therefore interpret the 75% estimate as an upper bound on the causal policy effect rather than

a point estimate of the true effect.
