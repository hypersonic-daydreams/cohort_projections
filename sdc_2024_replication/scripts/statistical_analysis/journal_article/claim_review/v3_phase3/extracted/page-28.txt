Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

the model to include ND-specific interaction terms (e.g., ND × Post2020) would require additional

identifying assumptions and is left for future work.

The level shift coefficient indicates that international migration dropped by 19,503 persons

immediately following COVID onset (t = −4.28, p < 0.001).
The trend change coefficient of

+14,113 (t = 4.29, p < 0.001) reflects the steep post-pandemic rebound slope during 2021–2024.

Relative to pre-COVID mean migration of 15,669, the level shift represents a 124.5% decline—

interpretable as a transition from positive to negative net migration during the acute pandemic

period.

Interpretive caveat: The large positive trend change coefficient is a mathematical artifact

of fitting a linear trend to the short, steep recovery period (2021–2024). With pre-COVID mean

migration of approximately 1,800 persons annually, a coefficient of +14,113 would imply explosive

growth if extrapolated—clearly implausible. This coefficient should be interpreted as describing the

short-run “rebound slope” rather than a sustainable long-term trajectory. Extrapolation beyond

the observed post-COVID window is not warranted.

Synthetic Comparator (Descriptive Benchmark)

Because the Travel Ban is a national shock, we do not interpret a state-level synthetic comparator

as causal. Instead, we construct a synthetic comparator that matches North Dakota’s pre-2017

international migration rate using weighted donor states. The weights emphasize Wyoming (41.9%),

Vermont (24.5%), Rhode Island (20.1%), and Washington (8.3%), with minor contributions from

Oregon (2.7%) and Florida (2.5%).

Pre-treatment fit is strong: the root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) of 0.020 indicates

close tracking during 2010–2016. The post-2017 gap averages +0.57 migrants per 1,000 population

(SD = 0.78), and the post/pre RMSPE ratio is large (48.6), indicating substantial divergence.

These deviations are presented descriptively and are not interpreted as policy effects.

Shift-Share (Bartik) Index

The shift-share index combines baseline state shares with leave-one-out national origin shocks to

summarize predicted refugee inflows. The first-stage F-statistic of 39.95 exceeds the conventional

threshold of 10, supporting instrument relevance.

The estimated first-stage coefficient is 5.51 (p < 0.001), indicating that a one-unit increase in

the shift-share index predicts a 5.51-unit increase in state-level international migration. Because

no second-stage causal model is estimated, this result is interpreted as predictive relevance rather

than a causal effect.

Duration Analysis

Duration analysis examines the lifecycle of immigration “waves”—sustained periods of elevated

arrivals from specific origin countries. Wave identification criteria require arrivals to exceed 150%
