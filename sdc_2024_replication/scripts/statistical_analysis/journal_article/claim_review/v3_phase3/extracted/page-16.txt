Shift-Share (Bartik) Index

To assess the predictive relevance of refugee-driven shocks for state-level migration, the analysis

constructs a shift-share (Bartik) index (Bartik, 1991; Goldsmith-Pinkham et al., 2020). The index

combines national-level “shifts” in immigration by origin country with state-level “shares” reflecting

historical settlement patterns:

Bdt =
�

o
ωod,t0 · gUS,−d
o,t
(16)

where ωod,t0 is origin o’s share of state d’s baseline arrivals and gUS,−d
o,t
is the leave-one-out national

change in arrivals from origin o (excluding state d).
Because no second-stage causal model is

estimated, the results are interpreted as first-stage relevance: the strength of the relationship

between predicted refugee inflows and state-level international migration.
Standard errors are

clustered by state; first-stage F-statistics assess instrument strength, with values exceeding 10

indicating adequate relevance.

2.9
Duration Analysis

Duration analysis examines the lifecycle of migration “waves”—sustained periods of elevated ar-

rivals from specific origin countries.
A wave is defined operationally as a period during which

arrivals from a nationality exceed 150% of that nationality’s baseline for two or more consecutive

years. This definition balances sensitivity (detecting genuine surges) against specificity (avoiding

false positives from random fluctuation).

The Kaplan-Meier estimator (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) provides nonparametric estimates of the

survival function S(t) = P(T > t), where T denotes wave duration:

ˆS(t) =
�

ti≤t

�
1 − di

ni

�
(17)

where di is the number of waves ending at time ti and ni is the number at risk. The log-rank test

evaluates whether survival curves differ across strata (e.g., intensity quartiles, origin regions).

The Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) relates the hazard rate—the instantaneous

probability of wave termination conditional on survival—to covariates:

h(t|x) = h0(t) exp(β′x)
