Abstract

International migration to small U.S. states presents distinctive forecasting challenges

characterized by high volatility, limited sample sizes, and heightened sensitivity to fed-

eral policy changes. While the demographic literature has extensively examined mi-

gration to gateway states, small peripheral states—where migration often determines

whether populations grow or decline—have received comparatively little rigorous em-

pirical attention. This study addresses this gap through the first comprehensive multi-

method analysis of international migration to North Dakota, deploying nine analytical

modules spanning descriptive statistics, time series econometrics, panel regression, grav-

ity models, machine learning, causal inference, and duration analysis using data from

2002–2024.

Key findings reveal that North Dakota’s migration profile is dominated by refugee

resettlement rather than economic migration chains, with Location Quotients exceeding

40 for Liberia and exceeding 20 for other West and East African origins. The time series

exhibits I(1) integration with a coefficient of variation of 82.5%, indicating that annual

flows can deviate from expectations by amounts approaching the mean itself. Structural

break analysis identifies significant regime shifts in 2020 and 2021 associated with the

COVID-19 pandemic (F = 16.01, p < 0.001).

Difference-in-differences estimation identifies a policy-associated divergence of ap-

proximately 75% in refugee arrivals from Travel Ban-affected countries (p = 0.032),

an effect that aggregate time series analysis fails to detect; however, pre-treatment

trend divergence suggests this estimate likely represents an upper bound on the causal

effect. Gravity model estimation reveals that diaspora associations lose statistical sig-

nificance when controlling for population mass (coefficient attenuates from 0.45 to 0.14,

p = 0.57), suggesting diaspora-linked allocation patterns remain modest in this cross-

sectional specification.
