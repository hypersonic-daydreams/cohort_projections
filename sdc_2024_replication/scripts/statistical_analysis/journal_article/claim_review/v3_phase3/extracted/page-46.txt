Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

resettlement decisions rather than economic migration chains—and the Travel Ban analysis demon-

strates that policy interventions affecting these source regions produce immediate and substantial

effects on state-level flows.
Demographic planners must recognize this policy dependence as a

fundamental feature of the forecasting problem.

Second, the high volatility of small-state migration requires scenario-based planning rather than

point forecasting. The coefficient of variation of 82.5%, the random-walk baseline characterization,

and the dramatic 2020 structural break collectively indicate that migration levels can shift by

amounts approaching the mean itself. The scenario range from 2,517 to 19,318 migrants by 2045

reflects this reality and should anchor contingent capacity planning.

Third, diaspora associations in North Dakota appear modest but present. The diaspora elastic-

ity of 0.14—below estimates from gateway state and cross-national studies—suggests that refugee

resettlement has not yet generated the self-reinforcing migration chains observed in more estab-

lished immigrant communities. This finding implies both vulnerability (migration depends heavily

on external policy rather than internal momentum) and opportunity (investments in community

development may strengthen diaspora associations over time).

Future Research Directions

Several avenues warrant further investigation.
Extension of this analytical framework to other

Great Plains states would assess whether North Dakota’s patterns generalize across the region or

reflect state-specific idiosyncrasies. States including South Dakota, Nebraska, and Minnesota share

demographic challenges and refugee resettlement participation, potentially enabling comparative

analysis of network development and policy sensitivity across contexts.

Incorporation of county-level dynamics would illuminate the geographic distribution of migra-

tion within North Dakota. Urban centers including Fargo and Grand Forks receive the majority

of refugee arrivals, but secondary migration to smaller communities may follow different patterns.

County-level analysis could inform local planning and identify communities where service capacity

constraints bind.

Integration with labor market outcomes would address whether international migration allevi-

ates the workforce shortages that motivate policy interest in immigration to rural regions. Linking

migration data to employment outcomes, wage dynamics, and industry-level labor supply could

quantify the economic contributions of immigrant populations and inform workforce development

investments.

Finally, real-time forecasting with updated data would enable the scenario framework developed

here to evolve as new information becomes available. The post-COVID recovery trajectory remains

incompletely characterized given data limitations; ongoing updates could refine the 2020 structural

break assessment and improve medium-term projections as the new migration regime stabilizes.

International migration to North Dakota occupies a distinctive position in American demog-

raphy: it is small in absolute terms, volatile over time, concentrated in humanitarian categories,
