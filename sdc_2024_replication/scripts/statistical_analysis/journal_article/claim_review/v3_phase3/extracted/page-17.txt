Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

where h0(t) is the baseline hazard and exp(βj) gives the hazard ratio associated with a one-unit

increase in covariate xj. Hazard ratios below unity indicate factors prolonging waves; ratios above

unity indicate factors accelerating termination. The proportional hazards assumption—that hazard

ratios remain constant over time—is evaluated through Schoenfeld residual tests. Model discrim-

ination is assessed by the concordance index (C-statistic), which measures the probability that

predicted hazards correctly rank pairs of observations by survival time.

Module-to-Scenario Integration

Table 3 summarizes how outputs from each analytical module feed into the scenario engine. This

mapping clarifies the role of each module in the forecasting pipeline: some modules provide di-

rect forecasting inputs (parameter estimates, uncertainty bounds), while others provide contextual

evidence that informs scenario interpretation but does not alter the forecast mechanics.

As Table 3 indicates, the VAR model (Module 2.2) and machine learning methods (Module 6)

serve primarily as auxiliary analyses. The VAR model contributes to AIC-based model averaging

weights but is not used for standalone long-horizon forecasting due to the infeasibility of obtaining

future national migration values. Similarly, ML methods (Elastic Net, Random Forest, K-means

clustering) provide feature importance rankings and state clustering for comparative context, but

do not directly parameterize the scenario trajectories. These modules support triangulation and

validation rather than primary forecast generation.

Scenario Construction

Scenario analysis translates analytical findings into forward-looking projections while explicitly

characterizing uncertainty. The analysis develops four policy-indexed scenarios spanning the range

of plausible future trajectories:

1. CBO Full: Uses ARIMA point forecasts scaled by 1.1 for 2025–2029, then compounds at 8%

annually from 2030 onward. This scenario represents an upper bound predicated on policy

liberalization.

2. Moderate: Uses ARIMA point forecasts for 2025–2029, then applies a dampened trend

(50% of the averaged robust trend estimate) through 2045.
This scenario represents the

central tendency forecast.

3. Pre-2020 Trend: Anchors at the 2019 level and extrapolates the 2010–2019 slope, treating

COVID as a temporary deviation.
This scenario provides a lower-bound estimate under

restrictive policy assumptions.

4. Zero: Assumes complete cessation of international migration, providing a floor for population

projection under extreme policy scenarios.
