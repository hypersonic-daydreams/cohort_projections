Notes: ADF = Augmented Dickey-Fuller; PP = Phillips-Perron; KPSS = Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-
Shin. KPSS null is stationarity; statsmodels reports 0.10 when p ≥ 0.10. Zivot–Andrews allows one endoge-
nous break (intercept). Sample: 2010–2024 (n = 15).

The divergence between criteria reflects the tension between model fit and parsimony in short

time series. The conservative BIC-based finding of no endogenous breaks supports treating the

2020 break as the primary structural change, consistent with the Chow test results.

VAR Model Results

Section 2.4 describes the VAR methodology, and Section 3.9 notes that the VAR model receives

effectively all AIC weight in model averaging. This section reports the underlying VAR diagnostics

and coefficient estimates.

Lag Selection and Model Fit.
Lag order selection across multiple criteria uniformly favors

VAR(1):

Criterion

HQIC

The VAR(1) model achieves R2 = 0.58 for the ND equation and R2 = 0.60 for the US equation,

with log-likelihood −305.9 and AIC = 38.87.

VAR Coefficient Estimates.
Table 18 reports the VAR(1) coefficient matrix. No individual

coefficient achieves statistical significance at the 5% level, reflecting the very short sample (n = 14

after differencing for lag construction) and wide confidence intervals characteristic of small-sample

VAR estimation.
