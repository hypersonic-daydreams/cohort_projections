the standard deviation approaches the mean in magnitude. By comparison, national net inter-

national migration exhibited somewhat lower volatility (CV = 73.5%), suggesting that state-level

flows experience amplified fluctuation relative to aggregate national trends.

The distribution of annual international migration to North Dakota exhibits positive skewness

(1.10), reflecting a right tail associated with recent high-migration years. The Shapiro-Wilk test

marginally fails to reject normality (W = 0.886, p = 0.058), though this finding warrants cautious

interpretation given the small sample size. No observations qualify as extreme outliers under the

interquartile range criterion, though the 2020 value of 30 migrants represents a dramatic departure

from typical levels.

Hodrick-Prescott filter decomposition reveals a U-shaped trend in North Dakota’s share of na-

tional international migration. The trend component declined from 0.211 in 2010 to a minimum

of 0.157 in 2014, subsequently rising to 0.185 by 2024. This pattern suggests that North Dakota’s

relative attractiveness to international migrants has recovered following the mid-decade trough, po-

tentially reflecting post-oil-boom economic restructuring and the resumption of refugee resettlement

programs.

Geographic Concentration

Analysis of geographic concentration reveals a divergence between country-level and regional-level

patterns. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for country-of-origin composition is 1,162 based

on FY 2023 LPR admissions, classifying North Dakota’s immigrant origins as “unconcentrated”

under standard thresholds (HHI < 1, 500). This result indicates substantial diversity at the country

level, with no single origin dominating the flow.

However, regional aggregation yields markedly different conclusions. The regional-level HHI

reaches 3,712, placing North Dakota firmly in the “highly concentrated” category (HHI > 2, 500).

This concentration derives from the dominance of two source regions: Asia accounts for 52.5% of

LPR admissions and Africa accounts for 27.9%, together comprising over 80% of legal permanent

resident flows. North America (12.3%), Europe (3.4%), South America (3.4%), and Oceania (0.6%)

contribute the remainder.
