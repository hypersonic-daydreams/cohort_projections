Notes: VAR(1) estimated on n = 14 annual observations (2011–2024). L1 = one-year lag. Coefficients
represent units of dependent variable per unit of lagged regressor. No coefficient is statistically significant
at α = 0.05.

Granger Causality.
Granger causality tests yield mixed conclusions depending on the test statis-

tic employed:

 US → ND: The χ2 test marginally rejects the null (χ2 = 4.10, p = 0.043), but the F-test does

not (F = 3.22, p = 0.100). This discrepancy reflects the small-sample size where asymptotic

χ2 approximations may be unreliable.

 ND → US: All tests fail to reject the null (p > 0.96), as expected given ND’s negligible share

of national migration.

Forecast Error Variance Decomposition.
By period 10, approximately 82% of ND forecast

error variance is attributable to ND’s own shocks, with 18% attributable to US shocks.
This

proportion stabilizes after period 4, suggesting that short-horizon forecasts are dominated by ND-

specific innovations while longer horizons incorporate modest US spillovers.

Cointegration.
Engle-Granger and Johansen tests yield conflicting results. The Engle-Granger

two-step procedure suggests cointegration (ADF on residuals: −4.48, p < 0.001), but the Johansen

trace test does not reject zero cointegrating relations at the 5% level (trace = 7.18, critical value =

15.49). Given the mixed integration orders of the component series (ND: I(1); US: I(0) per ADF)

and the very short sample, we do not impose a cointegrating restriction and proceed with VAR in

levels.

Role in Forecasting.
Despite receiving high AIC weight in model averaging, the VAR is not

used for standalone long-horizon forecasting because it requires future values of US international

migration—information unavailable at forecast time. The VAR’s contribution to the analysis is pri-

marily diagnostic: it confirms the contemporaneous ND–US correlation (cointegrating relationship)

and provides variance decomposition context for interpreting scenario uncertainty.

native covariance estimators, highlighting the inflation of uncertainty under clustered inference.
