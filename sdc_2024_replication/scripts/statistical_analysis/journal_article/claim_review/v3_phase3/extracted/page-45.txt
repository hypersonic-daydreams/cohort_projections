Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
45

Finally, findings from a single small state may not generalize to other contexts. North Dakota’s

unique position—combining refugee resettlement activity, oil economy dynamics, and Great Plains

demographic challenges—produces a migration profile that may not replicate in states with different

economic structures or resettlement histories. The methodological framework, rather than specific

parameter estimates, represents the more transferable contribution.

Summary of Contributions

This study offers three principal contributions to the migration forecasting literature.
First, it

provides the first comprehensive multi-method empirical analysis of international migration to a

small U.S. state. The nine-module analytical framework—spanning descriptive statistics, time se-

ries analysis, panel regression, gravity models, machine learning, causal inference, and duration

analysis—demonstrates that rigorous demographic analysis remains feasible even when small pop-

ulations and short time series strain conventional asymptotic methods. The multi-method design

explicitly trades depth within any single paradigm for robustness across paradigms, generating

convergent findings that warrant greater confidence than single-method analyses could support.

Second, the analysis demonstrates novel applications of causal inference methods to state-level

migration policy evaluation. The difference-in-differences estimate identifies a policy-associated di-

vergence of approximately 75% in refugee arrivals from Travel Ban-affected countries (p = 0.032),

though pre-treatment trend violations suggest this represents an upper bound on the causal effect.

A synthetic comparator provides descriptive benchmarking for North Dakota without causal inter-

pretation, and a shift-share index establishes first-stage relevance linking refugee-driven shocks to

state migration. Together, these elements extend the migration policy evaluation toolkit beyond

the national-level and gateway-state analyses that dominate existing literature while keeping causal

claims appropriately bounded.

Third, the study develops a rigorous framework for uncertainty quantification in long-range

migration forecasts. The scenario analysis distinguishes forecast uncertainty (parametric impreci-

sion within a policy regime) from scenario uncertainty (unknowable future policy choices), while

Monte Carlo simulation propagates parameter uncertainty through projection models to generate

probability distributions rather than misleadingly precise point estimates. The resulting 95% pre-

diction interval spanning a factor of 4.1 for 2045 migration honestly characterizes the structural

uncertainty inherent in this forecasting domain.

Key Takeaways

Three empirical conclusions emerge with particular force from the analysis. First, North Dakota’s

international migration is refugee-dominated and policy-sensitive. The Location Quotient analy-

sis reveals extreme overrepresentation of African and Middle Eastern origins—products of federal
