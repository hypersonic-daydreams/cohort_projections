2021; Cerqueira et al., 2019).

The structural break analysis reinforces this interpretation. The COVID-19 pandemic produced

a statistically significant break (F = 16.01, p < 0.001), but the 2017 Travel Ban—despite its

documented effects on refugee flows—left no detectable trace in aggregate state-level data. This

divergence between aggregate and composition-specific effects illustrates how structural instability

can manifest asymmetrically across analytical scales. The absence of a detectable aggregate break

during 2017 does not imply policy irrelevance; rather, it suggests that the Travel Ban’s effects

operated through compositional shifts that partially offset in aggregate.

4.1.3
Policy-Associated Divergence

The causal inference findings provide the study’s most policy-relevant contributions, though with

important caveats regarding causal interpretation. The difference-in-differences estimate identifies

a policy-associated divergence of approximately 75% in refugee arrivals from Travel Ban-affected

countries following policy implementation (p = 0.032). This magnitude exceeds what aggregate

analysis could detect because the Travel Ban’s effects concentrated on specific nationalities while

flows from other origins continued or even accelerated.

However, the parallel trends assumption—essential for causal identification in difference-in-

differences—is not satisfied over the full pre-treatment period. While the linear pre-trend test does

not reject parallel trends (p = 0.334), the event study joint pre-treatment test rejects when the

full pre-period is included (p < 0.001), with Figure 7 showing divergence beginning approximately

10 years before the policy. This pre-existing divergence means the 75% estimate likely conflates

the policy effect with underlying differences between treatment and control groups. We therefore

interpret the estimate as an upper bound on the causal policy effect rather than a point estimate of

the true effect. For future policy evaluation, this analysis demonstrates that nationality-level panel

methods can identify compositional effects that aggregate time series approaches miss, but also

highlights the importance of transparent reporting when identification assumptions are violated.

The COVID-19 analysis reveals an immediate level shift of approximately 19,500 migrants

(nationwide), followed by accelerated post-pandemic recovery. The recovery coefficient of +14,113

migrants per year captures the steep rebound slope during 2021–2024, though this coefficient is

a mathematical artifact of fitting a linear trend to a short recovery window and should not be

extrapolated as a long-run growth rate. Nevertheless, the rapid recovery suggests that immigration

systems can “bounce back” from acute shocks more rapidly than the random-walk baseline might

imply. This finding offers some optimism for demographic planners concerned about the lasting

effects of pandemic disruption, while cautioning against projecting the recovery slope indefinitely.

4.1.4
Forecast Uncertainty and Scenario Range

The scenario projections yield a 2045 range spanning 2,517 to 19,318 migrants—nearly an order of

magnitude—depending on policy assumptions. The Monte Carlo 95% prediction interval of 3,570

to 14,491 honestly characterizes the parametric uncertainty even within a given scenario. This wide
