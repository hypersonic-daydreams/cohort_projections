Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

exhibits a coefficient of variation of 82.5%, reflecting annual flows that have ranged from 30 to over

5,000 persons within a fifteen-year span. Time series of this brevity strain the asymptotic foun-

dations of standard econometric procedures; unit root tests lose power, ARIMA model selection

becomes unreliable, and long-horizon forecasts carry prediction intervals so wide as to approach

uninformativeness (Cerqueira et al., 2019; Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2021). The challenge,

then, is not merely to apply established methods but to develop an analytical framework suited to

the small-sample, high-volatility setting that characterizes migration to peripheral regions. Such

a framework must integrate multiple methodological traditions, triangulating findings across ap-

proaches while honestly characterizing the uncertainty inherent in projection.

This analysis addresses four interconnected research questions regarding international migration

to North Dakota:

1. Patterns and Sources: What are the dominant patterns and geographic sources of inter-

national migration to North Dakota, and how has the composition of this migration stream

evolved over time?

2. Time Series Properties: What statistical properties characterize the international migra-

tion time series—specifically, what is the order of integration, are structural breaks present,

and what degree of persistence or mean reversion do the data exhibit?

3. Policy Effects: What are the effects of major policy interventions—the 2017 Travel Ban and

the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic response—on international migration flows to North Dakota,

and what are the bounds on causal interpretation?

4. Future Scenarios: Given observed patterns and structural uncertainty, what is the range

of plausible future migration scenarios through 2045, and how should demographic planners

characterize forecast uncertainty?

These questions progress from descriptive characterization through inferential analysis to ap-

plied forecasting, reflecting the logical structure of demographic inquiry. Each question demands

distinct methodological approaches, and the answers collectively inform the population projection

enterprise.

This study makes three principal contributions to the migration forecasting literature. First,

it provides the first comprehensive multi-method empirical analysis of international migration to a

small U.S. state. The analysis deploys nine interconnected methodological modules spanning de-

scriptive statistics, time series analysis, panel regression, gravity models, machine learning, causal

inference, and duration analysis. This methodological breadth serves not eclecticism but triangu-

lation: findings that emerge consistently across disparate analytical frameworks warrant greater

confidence than those dependent on particular modeling assumptions. The multi-method design

explicitly addresses the small-sample challenge by trading depth within any single paradigm for

robustness across paradigms.
