with a 0.14% increase in new admissions (full model)

(B) Diaspora Effect by Specification

Figure 6: Gravity model estimation results. Panel (A) shows coefficient estimates with 95% con-
fidence intervals for the full gravity specification: diaspora association (log diaspora stock), origin
mass (log origin stock in U.S.), and destination mass (log state foreign-born total). Panel (B)
compares diaspora association estimates across model specifications, showing that controlling for
mass variables reduces the diaspora coefficient from 0.45 to approximately 0.14.
