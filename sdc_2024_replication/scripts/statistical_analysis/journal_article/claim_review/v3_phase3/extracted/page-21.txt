Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
21

Dakota relative to national immigrant composition. Table 5 reports LQ values for the ten most

overrepresented origins. Liberia exhibits the highest LQ (40.83), indicating that North Dakota’s

share of Liberian-born residents exceeds the national share by a factor of forty.
Other highly

overrepresented origins include Ivory Coast (LQ = 26.19), Somalia (LQ = 22.42), and Tanzania

(LQ = 15.13). This pattern reflects the legacy of refugee resettlement programs that have directed

migrants from specific African origin countries to North Dakota.

Notes: LQ = Location Quotient.
Values exceeding 1.0 indicate overrepresentation relative to national
composition. Data from American Community Survey 2023.

The concentration patterns exhibit meaningful temporal evolution.
Country-level HHI has

increased from 482 in 2012 to 942 in 2023, though the trend is not statistically significant (p =

0.242). Regional-level HHI shows more pronounced increases, rising from approximately 2,600 in

the early 2010s to over 5,200 in 2022–2023, reflecting growing reliance on African and Asian source

regions.

Time Series Properties

Unit root diagnostics inform integration choices for subsequent time series modeling.
Table 6

reports Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test results for the three primary series.

North Dakota international migration does not reject the unit root null in levels (p = 0.556)

but rejects after first differencing (p = 0.002), consistent with I(1) behavior. North Dakota’s share

of national migration shows the same ADF pattern (level p = 0.285; differenced p < 0.001). In

contrast, national international migration rejects the unit root null in levels (p = 0.002), consistent

with I(0) behavior.

KPSS tests (null: level-stationarity; regression = constant) do not reject level-stationarity for

the ND migration series (p ≥ 0.10), while KPSS rejects level-stationarity for the first-differenced ND

share series (p ≈ 0.042). Together with ADF results, the small-sample diagnostics are suggestive

rather than definitive: integration order is treated as a modeling choice, with break-robust checks
