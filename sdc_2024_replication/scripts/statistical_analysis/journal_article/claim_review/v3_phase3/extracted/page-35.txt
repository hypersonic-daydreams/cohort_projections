Figure 5: Structural break analysis for North Dakota international migration. Panel (A) shows
the time series with segmented regression fits before and after 2020, with Chow test statistics
indicating a significant break (F = 16.01, p < 0.001). Panel (B) displays the CUSUM test for
parameter stability, where the test statistic (solid line) remains within the 95% critical bounds
(dashed lines), suggesting overall parameter stability despite the level shift.
