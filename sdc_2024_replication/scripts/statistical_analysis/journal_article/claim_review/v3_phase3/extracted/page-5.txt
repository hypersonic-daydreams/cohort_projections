Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
5

Second, the analysis offers novel applications of causal inference methods to state-level migration

policy evaluation. Difference-in-differences estimation, applied to refugee arrivals before and after

the 2017 Travel Ban, identifies a policy-associated divergence of approximately 75% in the first full

post years (p = 0.032), an effect that aggregate time series analysis fails to detect. Because the joint

pre-treatment test rejects parallel trends over the full pre-period, this estimate likely conflates the

policy effect with pre-existing divergence and should be interpreted as an upper bound. Because

the Travel Ban is a national shock, a synthetic comparator is used only as a descriptive benchmark

for North Dakota’s international migration rate, not a causal counterfactual. A shift-share index

based on leave-one-out national shocks provides first-stage relevance linking refugee-driven inflows

to state migration. These applications demonstrate that policy-sensitive inference remains feasible

in small-state settings when identification assumptions are stated and bounded.

Third, the study develops a rigorous framework for uncertainty quantification in long-range

migration forecasts. Monte Carlo simulation propagates parameter uncertainty through projection

models, generating probability distributions rather than point estimates for future migration. The

resulting 95% prediction interval for 2045 international migration spans 3,570 to 14,491 persons—a

factor of 4.1 times—honestly reflecting the structural uncertainty that characterizes this domain.

This probabilistic framing enables demographic planners to assess the full range of contingencies

rather than anchoring on misleadingly precise point forecasts (Raftery et al., 2014). The scenario

analysis further distinguishes between forecast uncertainty (arising from model imprecision) and

scenario uncertainty (arising from unknowable future policy regimes), providing a framework for

structured demographic planning under deep uncertainty.

The remainder of this article proceeds as follows.
Section 2 describes the data sources—

Census Bureau Population Estimates, Department of Homeland Security admission records, Amer-

ican Community Survey foreign-born tabulations, and refugee arrival databases—and presents the

methodological framework in detail. Section 3 reports findings organized by analytical module,

beginning with descriptive patterns and concentration analysis, proceeding through time series di-

agnostics and panel regression results, and culminating in causal estimates and scenario projections.

Section 4 interprets these findings in light of migration theory and prior empirical work, addresses

policy implications for refugee resettlement and demographic planning, and acknowledges the lim-

itations inherent in small-sample analysis. Section 5 summarizes the contributions and identifies

directions for future research.

Data and Methods

This section describes the data sources underlying the analysis and presents the methodological

framework employed across nine analytical modules. The multi-method design reflects both the

complexity of international migration dynamics and the inferential challenges posed by small-sample

settings. Each methodological tradition contributes distinct insights: descriptive methods establish

baseline patterns; time series techniques characterize dynamic properties; regression approaches
