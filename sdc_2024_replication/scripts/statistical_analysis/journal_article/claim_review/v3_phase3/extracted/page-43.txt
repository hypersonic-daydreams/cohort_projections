Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
43

Protracted conflicts in Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Iraq have generated sustained displacement that

supports multi-year resettlement waves, while refugee situations in the Americas and Europe more

often resolve or divert to alternative destinations within shorter timeframes.

Policy Implications

4.3.1
State-Level Planning and Service Provision

The high volatility and policy sensitivity documented here carry direct implications for state and

local planning. Social service agencies, school districts, and healthcare providers must accommodate

populations that can fluctuate dramatically across years.
The coefficient of variation of 82.5%

implies that year-to-year migration can deviate from expectations by amounts approaching the

mean itself. Traditional planning models premised on smooth population growth require substantial

adaptation for this setting.

The scenario framework offers a practical response. Rather than planning for a single projected

trajectory, agencies can develop tiered capacity plans corresponding to different scenario outcomes.

The “Moderate” scenario projection of 7,048 migrants by 2045 might anchor baseline planning,

while the “CBO Full” scenario of 19,318 could inform contingency capacity investments. Impor-

tantly, the “Pre-2020 Trend” scenario of 2,517 should inform downside planning for scenarios in

which national immigration policy or refugee admissions shift restrictively.

4.3.2
Sensitivity to Federal Immigration Policy

The 75% policy-associated divergence identified in the Travel Ban analysis—even if an upper bound

on the true causal effect—underscores how dependent state-level migration is on federal policy

decisions entirely outside state control. North Dakota receives disproportionate shares of migrants

from countries frequently subject to policy intervention—the Travel Ban’s affected nations overlap

substantially with the state’s top source countries. This exposure creates planning risks that states

like California or Texas, with more diversified migration portfolios, face to a lesser degree.

State policymakers might consider this vulnerability when advocating for immigration policy

positions at the federal level. The analysis provides quantitative evidence that restrictive poli-

cies targeting African and Middle Eastern origins disproportionately affect states participating in

refugee resettlement, potentially with lasting demographic consequences given the random-walk

baseline properties of migration flows.

4.3.3
Refugee Resettlement and Network Development

The modest diaspora association (0.140) suggests that North Dakota’s refugee communities, while

established, have not yet generated the self-reinforcing migration chains observed in traditional

gateway communities. This finding may reflect the early stage of community development—many

North Dakota refugee communities date only to the post-2000 period—or structural barriers to

chain migration among refugee populations facing continued restrictions on family reunification.
