Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
19

Monte Carlo simulation propagates uncertainty through projection models by sampling from

estimated parameter distributions. The procedure draws 1,000 realizations of model parameters,

generates projected trajectories for each draw, and summarizes the resulting distribution through

percentiles. The 50% prediction interval spans the 25th to 75th percentiles; the 95% prediction

interval spans the 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles. This approach quantifies forecast uncertainty arising

from parameter estimation imprecision while holding the structural model fixed.

Model averaging combines forecasts from multiple specifications using AIC-derived weights:

wm =
exp(−∆m/2)
�M
j=1 exp(−∆j/2)
(19)

where ∆m = AICm − AICmin is the AIC difference between model m and the best-fitting model.

Weighted averaging reduces dependence on any single specification while preserving interpretability

(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2021).

Implementation

All analyses were conducted in Python 3.11.
Time series analysis employed statsmodels for

ARIMA, VAR, and unit root tests. Panel data models were estimated using linearmodels. Ma-

chine learning methods used scikit-learn for Elastic Net, Random Forest, and clustering. Sur-

vival analysis employed the lifelines package for Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox regression.

Structural break detection used the ruptures package. Replication code and data are available in

the supplementary materials.

Results

This section presents findings from the nine-module analytical pipeline, organized to parallel the

methodological sequence described in Section 2. Results progress from descriptive characterization

through time series analysis, regression-based modeling, causal inference, duration analysis, and

scenario projections. Throughout, we report point estimates, standard errors, and p-values to facil-

itate comparison with prior work; however, readers should interpret significance claims cautiously

given the small samples and few clusters characteristic of state-level migration analysis. Where

sample sizes permit only limited inference, we emphasize effect sizes and confidence intervals over

binary significance thresholds.

Descriptive Patterns

Table 4 presents summary statistics for PEPnet international migration (the PEPinternational

migration component of change) to North Dakota and the United States over the 2010–2024 ob-

servation period. North Dakota’s net international migration averaged 1,796 persons annually (SE

= 383), with substantial volatility: the coefficient of variation (CV) reached 82.5%, indicating that
