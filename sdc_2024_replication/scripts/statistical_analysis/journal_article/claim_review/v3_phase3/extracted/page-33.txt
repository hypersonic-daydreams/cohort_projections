Figure 3: Geographic concentration of foreign-born population in North Dakota by country of origin
(2023). Bars show location quotients (LQ), where LQ > 1 indicates overrepresentation relative to
the national average. The dashed vertical line marks LQ = 1. Countries are sorted by LQ value; bar
intensity reflects population size (darker indicates larger foreign-born population in North Dakota).
Liberia, Ivory Coast, Somalia, and other African origin countries show the highest concentration
relative to their national presence, reflecting refugee resettlement patterns.
