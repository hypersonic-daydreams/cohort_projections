Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

populations—such as foreign-born from specific countries residing in North Dakota—coefficients of

variation can exceed 30%, requiring cautious interpretation. The analysis addresses this limitation

by focusing on origin groups with sufficient sample sizes and by aggregating to regional categories

where country-level estimates prove unreliable.

Refugee Processing Center Arrival Data

The Refugee Processing Center (RPC), operated by the Department of State, maintains compre-

hensive records of refugee arrivals by state of initial resettlement and nationality. This analysis

employs arrival data spanning fiscal years 2002–2020, providing the longest time series among the

data sources and enabling duration analysis of migration “waves” from specific origin countries.

The refugee data prove particularly valuable for North Dakota given the state’s significant refugee

population, which drives much of the geographic concentration observed in other data sources.

Refugee arrival data offer precise counts (not estimates) of a well-defined population admitted

through federal resettlement programs. Limitations include truncation at fiscal year 2020 (pre-

cluding analysis of pandemic recovery) and restriction to initial placement, which may differ from

eventual settlement after secondary migration.

Descriptive and Concentration Methods

Descriptive analysis establishes baseline patterns in international migration flows and characterizes

their distributional properties.
Summary statistics—means, standard deviations, coefficients of

variation, skewness, and kurtosis—quantify central tendency and dispersion.
The coefficient of

variation (CV), defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean, provides a scale-invariant

measure of volatility suitable for comparing series of different magnitudes.

To decompose observed migration flows into trend and cyclical components, the analysis employs

the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter (Hodrick and Prescott, 1997). The HP filter solves the optimization

problem:

t=1
(yt − gt)2 + λ

t=2
[(gt+1 − gt) − (gt − gt−1)]2

(1)

where yt denotes the observed series, gt the trend component, and λ the smoothing parameter

controlling the penalty on trend acceleration. Following Ravn and Uhlig (2002), the analysis sets

λ = 6.25 for annual data, a value calibrated to achieve comparable smoothing across observation

frequencies.

Geographic concentration analysis employs two complementary measures.
The Herfindahl-

Hirschman Index (HHI) quantifies concentration across origin countries:

where si denotes the share of migration from origin country i. HHI values below 1,500 indicate
