Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
24

Notably, the 2017 Travel Ban shows no statistically significant break at the aggregate North

Dakota level (F = 1.29, p = 0.314). This null result contrasts with the significant Travel Ban

effects identified in the nationality-level difference-in-differences analysis (Section 3.7), suggesting

that aggregate flows may mask compositional shifts in origin countries.

The CUSUM test for parameter stability corroborates these findings. The cumulative sum of

recursive residuals remains within the 5% significance bounds throughout the observation period

(maximum CUSUM = 2.37, bound = 10.25), indicating no evidence of continuous parameter drift.

The stability ratio of 0.23 suggests that cumulative deviations from the fitted model remain modest

relative to permissible fluctuation.

The Bai-Perron procedure for endogenous break detection identifies zero breaks under the BIC

criterion, reflecting the penalty imposed on additional parameters in the short series. This result

highlights the tension between data-driven and theory-driven break identification in small samples.

Panel Data Results

Panel analysis exploits cross-state and temporal variation to examine determinants of international

migration allocation. The estimation sample comprises 765 state-year observations (51 states × 15

years), forming a balanced panel.

The Hausman specification test compares fixed effects and random effects estimators. Under the

null hypothesis that random effects estimates are consistent and efficient, the test statistic follows

a chi-squared distribution.
The computed test statistic is effectively zero (H = 7.18 × 10−31,

p = 1.000), indicating no systematic difference between estimators and thus supporting random

effects as the preferred specification. The Breusch-Pagan LM test strongly rejects pooled OLS in

favor of the random effects model (χ2 = 1, 502, p < 0.001), confirming the presence of state-level

heterogeneity requiring panel methods.

State fixed effects from the two-way specification reveal substantial cross-sectional variation

in international migration levels. Florida exhibits the largest positive effect (+125,526 relative to

the grand mean), followed by California (+106,259) and Texas (+89,232). North Dakota’s fixed

effect of −18,022 places it near the bottom of the distribution, exceeded in negativity only by

Wyoming (−19,332). This ranking accords with population-weighted expectations and confirms

North Dakota’s status as a minor destination in absolute terms.

Year fixed effects capture common temporal shocks affecting all states. The 2020 effect is dra-

matically negative, reflecting the near-cessation of international migration during pandemic travel

restrictions. Mean international migration in 2020 was 390 compared to 21,206 in other years—a

98.2% reduction. The between-within variance ratio of 1.30 indicates that cross-state variation

slightly exceeds within-state temporal variation, though both dimensions contribute meaningfully

to total variability.
