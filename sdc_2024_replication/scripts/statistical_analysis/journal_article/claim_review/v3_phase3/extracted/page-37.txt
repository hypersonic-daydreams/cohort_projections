Event Study: Travel Ban Effect on Refugee Arrivals

Reference period

Figure 7: Event study estimates for the Travel Ban effect on refugee arrivals. Coefficients represent
the difference in log arrivals between treated countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,
Yemen) and control countries relative to the reference period (t = −1, 2017). Blue circles show
pre-treatment estimates; red squares show post-treatment effects. The joint pre-trend test rejects
parallel trends over the full pre-period (F = 4.31, p < 0.001). The average treatment effect on the
treated (ATT) is −1.38 (p = 0.032), corresponding to a 74.9% reduction in arrivals.
