Machine Learning Methods

Machine learning methods complement traditional regression by providing flexible functional forms

and systematic variable selection. The analysis employs three techniques: Elastic Net regulariza-

tion, Random Forest regression, and K-means clustering.

Elastic Net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties, solving:

ˆβ = arg min
β

� n
�

i=1
(yi − x′
iβ)2 + λ
�
α∥β∥1 + (1 − α)∥β∥2
2
�
�

(11)

where λ controls overall regularization strength and α ∈ [0, 1] balances sparsity-inducing L1 penalty

against coefficient-shrinking L2 penalty. Cross-validation selects (λ, α) values. Coefficients shrunk

exactly to zero identify variables excluded from the predictive model.

Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) aggregates predictions from an ensemble of decision trees,

each trained on bootstrap samples with random feature subsets. Feature importance is measured

by permutation importance: the decrease in out-of-bag prediction accuracy when feature values

are randomly shuffled.

K-means clustering partitions states into groups exhibiting similar migration profiles.
The

algorithm minimizes within-cluster sum of squared distances to cluster centroids:

arg min

K

k=1

i∈Ck
∥xi − µk∥2

where Ck denotes cluster k and µk its centroid. Optimal cluster count K is selected by the silhouette

criterion.

Causal Inference Methods

Causal inference methods estimate the effects of specific policy interventions—the 2017 Travel

Ban and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic—on international migration flows. Identification relies on

nationality-level difference-in-differences and a state-level interrupted time series. Two additional

components provide context: a synthetic comparator for descriptive benchmarking and a shift-share

index used to assess the predictive relevance of refugee-driven shocks.

2.8.1
Difference-in-Differences

The Travel Ban analysis employs a difference-in-differences (DiD) design comparing refugee arrivals

from affected countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen) to arrivals from unaffected

countries, before and after the 2017 implementation. The estimating equation specifies:

ln(yct + 1) = αc + λt + δ · (Affectedc × Postt) + εct
