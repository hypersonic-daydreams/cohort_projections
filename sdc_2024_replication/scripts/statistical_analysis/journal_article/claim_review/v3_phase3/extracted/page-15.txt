Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

where yct denotes arrivals from country c in year t, αc and λt are country and year fixed effects,

and the coefficient δ identifies the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). The logarithmic

transformation accommodates the multiplicative nature of policy effects; the addition of unity

handles zero arrivals.

Identification requires the parallel trends assumption: absent the Travel Ban, affected and

unaffected countries would have exhibited similar trends in arrivals. The analysis evaluates this

assumption through pre-treatment trend tests and graphical inspection of pre-period trajectories.

Standard errors are clustered by nationality to account for serial correlation within origin groups.

Small-sample inference robustness. With only seven treated nationalities, conventional

cluster-robust inference may be unreliable (Cameron et al., 2008). We supplement clustered stan-

dard errors with two small-sample approaches.
First, wild cluster bootstrap with Rademacher

weights generates the null distribution by resampling cluster-level residuals under the null hypoth-

esis of no treatment effect; bootstrap p-values correct for the small number of treated clusters.

Second, randomization (permutation) inference implements Fisher’s exact test by permuting the

treatment assignment across clusters and computing the proportion of permutations yielding an

ATT as extreme as observed. Both approaches provide finite-sample valid inference without relying

on asymptotic cluster count assumptions.

Restricted pre-period robustness. When the joint pre-trend test rejects parallel trends

over the full pre-period, we re-estimate the DiD restricting to years where pre-trends appear more

plausibly parallel. If event study coefficients show greater divergence in early years than in years

immediately preceding treatment, restricting the pre-period strengthens the parallel trends assump-

tion at the cost of reduced sample size.

Interrupted Time Series (COVID-19)

The COVID-19 analysis uses a state-level interrupted time series with state fixed effects to identify

both an immediate level shift and a post-2020 trend change:

yst = αs + β1t + β2Post2020,t + β3(t − 2020)Post2020,t + εst
(14)

where yst is net international migration for state s in year t.
The coefficient β2 captures the

immediate COVID-19 level shift, and β3 captures the change in trend after 2020. Standard errors

are clustered by state.

Synthetic Comparator (Descriptive Benchmark)

Because the Travel Ban is a national shock, donor states are not untreated. We therefore use a

synthetic comparator (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) only as a descriptive

benchmark. The comparator trajectory is constructed by weighting donor states to match North
