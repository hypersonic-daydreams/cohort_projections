Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

range reflects multiple uncertainty sources: inherent migration volatility (CV = 82.5%), structural

instability evidenced by the 2020 break, and the fundamental unpredictability of future immigration

policy.

Rather than viewing this uncertainty as a failure of analysis, demographic planners should

recognize it as an accurate representation of the forecasting problem.
The scenario framework

distinguishes between forecast uncertainty (arising from model imprecision given a policy regime)

and scenario uncertainty (arising from unknowable future policy choices) (Raftery et al., 2014).

This distinction enables planners to develop contingent strategies that perform reasonably across

the outcome range rather than optimizing for a single misleadingly precise point forecast.

Comparison with Prior Literature

The gravity model findings invite comparison with the established migration literature. The di-

aspora association of 0.140—from the full gravity specification with two-way clustered SEs—falls

below estimates reported in prior cross-national studies and is imprecisely estimated in this cross-

section. Beine et al. (2011) estimate diaspora elasticities ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 in their analysis

of bilateral migration determinants, while Mayda (2010) reports coefficients of similar magnitude

in panel specifications.

Several factors may explain North Dakota’s attenuated diaspora association. First, the state’s

migration composition tilts heavily toward refugees, whose placement decisions are mediated by

resettlement agencies rather than purely by network connections (Bansak et al., 2018). Second,

North Dakota’s small absolute foreign-born population may generate insufficient network density to

support the information transmission and chain migration mechanisms that produce larger diaspora

effects in traditional gateway states. Third, the cross-sectional PPML specification, while method-

ologically appropriate following Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), captures static associations that

may understate the dynamic effects of network accumulation over time.

The finding that destination foreign-born totals dominate migration allocation (elasticity =

0.792) accords with gravity model theory and prior empirical work.
Anderson and van Win-

coop (2003) emphasize that bilateral flows reflect multilateral resistance—the attractiveness of

alternatives—rather than purely bilateral factors. In this framework, North Dakota’s modest pop-

ulation and peripheral geographic position generate substantial resistance that diaspora associations

cannot fully overcome.

The duration analysis findings contribute to a smaller literature on refugee arrival lifecycles.

The median wave duration of 3.0 years, with higher-intensity waves persisting substantially longer

(median 4 years for Q4 versus 2 years for Q1), suggests that refugee resettlement operates in

episodic surges rather than continuous streams. This pattern may reflect the bureaucratic and

logistical constraints of resettlement operations, which can process only limited throughput and

must ramp up capacity to handle crisis-driven caseload spikes (Phillimore et al., 2022).

The finding that African and Asian waves outlast European and American waves (mean duration

4+ years versus approximately 2 years) aligns with the character of contemporary refugee crises.
