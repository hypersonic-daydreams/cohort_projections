Small-sample inference robustness. With only seven treated clusters (nationalities), con-

ventional cluster-robust inference may be unreliable. Table 11 reports alternative p-values from

wild cluster bootstrap and randomization inference. For the full pre-period specification, the wild

cluster bootstrap yields p = 0.077 and randomization inference yields p = 0.058—both above the

conventional α = 0.05 threshold, though significant at α = 0.10.
This attenuation relative to

the conventional p = 0.032 reflects the small number of treated clusters and suggests caution in

claiming strong statistical significance.

Restricted pre-period robustness. Because the event study reveals greater pre-trend diver-

gence in early years (2002–2012) than in years immediately preceding treatment, we re-estimate the

DiD restricting to years where parallel trends appear more plausible. Restricting the pre-period

to 2013–2017 substantially improves the pre-trend diagnostic: the joint F-test yields F = 0.76,

p = 0.553, failing to reject parallel trends. The ATT estimate increases in magnitude to −1.983

(SE = 0.506), and inference strengthens: the conventional p-value falls to p < 0.001, with bootstrap

(p = 0.003) and randomization (p = 0.004) inference confirming significance at the 1% level.

This pattern—larger ATT magnitude and stronger significance with the restricted pre-period—

suggests that the full-sample estimate is attenuated by pre-existing negative divergence between

treatment and control groups.
When analysis focuses on years where parallel trends are more

defensible, the estimated policy effect is larger (−86% vs. −75%) and more precisely estimated. The

restricted-period results strengthen confidence that the Travel Ban produced a genuine reduction

in refugee arrivals from affected countries, though the magnitude remains subject to specification

uncertainty.

COVID-19 Interrupted Time Series

The COVID-19 analysis employs state-level panel data (2010–2024) with 2020 as the intervention

year. The interrupted time series model identifies both level and trend effects.

Scope of inference: The ITS specification includes state fixed effects and estimates the average

COVID disruption across all U.S. states, not a North Dakota-specific effect. Because COVID-19

and associated travel restrictions affected all states simultaneously, the model cannot separately

identify whether North Dakota experienced a differential disruption relative to other states. The

coefficients reported below describe the mean state-level response; ND-specific deviations from

this average are absorbed by the state fixed effect and are not separately estimated. Extending
