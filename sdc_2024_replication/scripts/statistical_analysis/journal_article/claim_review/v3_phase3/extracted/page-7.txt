2.2.1
Estimand & Measurement

Forecast target (estimand). Let Yt denote North Dakota’s annual net international migration

in year t, measured as the PEP“international migration” component of change for North Dakota

(persons; net).1 We treat Yt as the primary dependent variable for forecasting and scenario pro-

jections in this paper. Unless otherwise noted, the generic notation yt used in subsequent module

equations denotes the observed PEPnet international migration series. Our forecasting goal is to

characterize the predictive distribution of Yt+h for horizons h ∈ {1, . . . , H} (2025–2045), conditional

on information available through year t.

Auxiliary data sources. DHS lawful permanent resident (LPR) admissions, Refugee Pro-

cessing Center (RPC) refugee arrivals, and ACSforeign-born stock estimates are not alternative

outcomes; they are used to (i) characterize and partially decompose international migration, (ii)

construct predictors (e.g., diaspora measures and origin-composition features), and (iii) triangulate

mechanisms and scenario sensitivity.

Time base and harmonization. PEPestimates are reported on an estimate-year basis, while

DHS and RPC series are reported in fiscal years and ACSestimates in survey years. We preserve

native time bases and label them explicitly; when fiscal-year series are used as predictors for PEP-

year outcomes, we align them using an overlap-weighted crosswalk XPEP

and we report sensitivity to one-year shifts where timing is ambiguous.

These sources are related but not interchangeable: PEPinternational migration is a net com-

ponent of population accounting, DHS and RPC series are gross inflows on a fiscal-year basis, and

ACSseries are stocks subject to sampling error. Throughout the paper we label flow/stock status

and time base (FY vs. PEP-year vs. survey year) in text, tables, and figure captions to prevent

target drift.

1PEP“year t” corresponds to the annual component-of-change interval used in producing July 1 population es-
timates (a demographic year rather than a strict January–December calendar year). We refer to it as “year t” for
readability and explicitly label fiscal-year sources as FY.
