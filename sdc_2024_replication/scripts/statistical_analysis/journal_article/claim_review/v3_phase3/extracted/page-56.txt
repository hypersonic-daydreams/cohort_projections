Notes: Estimates come from the full gravity specification in Table 15. Clustered SEs account for correlation
within destinations and origins.

The point estimate is stable across covariance estimators, but clustered SEs are substantially

larger than model-based SEs. We therefore report two-way clustered inference in the main text.

DiD Parallel Trends Robustness

The parallel trends assumption is evaluated through multiple approaches:

1. Pre-treatment trend test: The interaction between Affected and a linear pre-treatment

trend yields 0.087 (t = 0.97, p = 0.334). The test fails to reject parallel trends.

2. Placebo treatment dates: Placebo tests shifting the treatment date to 2015 or 2016 were

conducted in the prior HC3 specification; these checks should be re-run under clustered

inference.

3. Event study plot: Figure 7 shows negative post-treatment coefficients in 2018–2019, but the

joint pre-treatment test rejects parallel trends when the full pre-period is included (p < 0.001),

indicating longer-run divergence.

Scenario Arithmetic

This section documents the update rules used to generate scenario paths in Module 9.

CBO Full.
For 2025–2029, projections use 10% above the ARIMA point forecasts. From 2030

onward, values compound at 8% annually:

cbo_t = 1.1 * arima_t
(t = 2025..2029)

cbo_t = cbo_{t-1} * 1.08 (t >= 2030)

Pre-2020 Trend.
The series is anchored at the 2019 value (y2019 = 634) with a slope estimated

from 2010–2019 (ˆβ = 72.43 per year):

pre2020_t = y_2019 + beta * (t - 2019)
