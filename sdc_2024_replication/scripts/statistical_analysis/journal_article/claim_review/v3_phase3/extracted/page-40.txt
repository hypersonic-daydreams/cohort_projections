Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

4.1
Interpretation of Key Findings

4.1.1
Patterns and Sources of International Migration

The geographic concentration analysis reveals a distinctive migration profile that diverges markedly

from national patterns. While North Dakota’s country-level immigrant origins appear diverse (HHI

= 1,162, classified as “unconcentrated”), regional aggregation tells a different story: the regional-

level HHI of 3,712 indicates high concentration, with Asia and Africa together comprising over 80%

of legal permanent resident flows. This apparent paradox—country-level diversity masking regional

concentration—reflects North Dakota’s role in the national refugee resettlement infrastructure.

The Location Quotient findings provide the clearest evidence of this distinctive profile. Liberia

(LQ = 40.83), Ivory Coast (LQ = 26.19), Somalia (LQ = 22.42), and other African nations exhibit

extraordinary overrepresentation relative to national immigrant composition. These patterns are

not accidents of economic migration but rather artifacts of humanitarian policy: federal refugee

resettlement programs, operating through local voluntary agencies, have systematically directed

arrivals from conflict zones to North Dakota communities (Bansak et al., 2018; Winders, 2022).

The resulting ethnic enclaves—now spanning generations in some cases—create the foundation for

diaspora associations that shape subsequent migration streams.

The temporal evolution of concentration patterns merits attention.
Regional-level HHI has

increased substantially from approximately 2,600 in the early 2010s to over 5,200 by 2022–2023,

indicating growing reliance on African and Asian source regions. This trajectory suggests that

North Dakota’s migration profile is becoming more distinctive over time, diverging further from

the national pattern rather than converging toward it. For demographic planning purposes, this

implies that North Dakota cannot simply extrapolate from national trends but must account for

its idiosyncratic position within the immigration system.

4.1.2
Time Series Properties and Forecasting Implications

The time series diagnostics are consistent with an approximately integrated process, and the AIC-

selected ARIMA(0,1,0) baseline provides a random-walk benchmark for forecasting. Under this

baseline, the best forecast of future migration equals the most recent observation, with innovations

representing unpredictable shocks. This characterization implies limited mean reversion within the

sample: departures from historical averages can persist rather than quickly self-correct.

For practitioners, the random-walk baseline counsels humility. The five-year-ahead prediction

interval spanning from 212 to over 10,000 migrants reflects not merely statistical imprecision but

fundamental unpredictability in the migration process. Standard demographic projection methods

that assume stable parameters or mean-reverting dynamics may generate misleadingly precise fore-

casts when applied to migration time series with these properties (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos,
