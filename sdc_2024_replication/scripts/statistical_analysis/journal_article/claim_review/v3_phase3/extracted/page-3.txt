Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

Introduction

North Dakota occupies a distinctive position in the landscape of American immigration. With

a population of approximately 780,000—ranking 47th among U.S. states—the state receives just

0.17% of national international migration flows, a proportion noticeably smaller than its 0.23% share

of the U.S. population (Wilson et al., 2022). Yet this modest arithmetic masks a demographic

reality of considerable consequence. In a state where natural population growth has stagnated

and domestic out-migration persists, international migration has emerged as a critical—and at

times dominant—component of population change. Understanding the patterns, drivers, and future

trajectories of this migration stream carries implications not only for North Dakota’s demographic

planning but also for the broader challenge of sustaining communities in America’s rural heartland.

The Great Plains has experienced sustained population decline throughout much of the twen-

tieth and early twenty-first centuries, a demographic trajectory shaped by agricultural consolida-

tion, limited economic diversification, and the magnetic pull of metropolitan opportunity elsewhere

(Albrecht, 1993; Archer and Lonsdale, 2003). North Dakota’s brief reversal of this trend during

the Bakken oil boom (2010–2014) demonstrated how economic shocks can temporarily reshape

demographic patterns, yet the underlying structural forces favoring out-migration have proven re-

silient (Weber et al., 2014). Against this backdrop, international migration—particularly refugee

resettlement—has assumed an outsized role in maintaining population levels and meeting labor

force demands in communities throughout the state.

Refugee resettlement programs have channeled arrivals from conflict zones worldwide to North

Dakota communities, creating ethnic enclaves that now span generations. The state’s foreign-born

population reflects this history: Location Quotient analysis reveals that North Dakota hosts dis-

proportionately large shares of migrants from East African origins (Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia) and

Middle Eastern countries (Iraq, Syria) relative to national patterns. These concentrations, prod-

ucts of federal resettlement policy interacting with local voluntary agency capacity, create diaspora

networks that are predictive of subsequent migration streams (Beine et al., 2011; Bansak et al.,

2018). The result is a migration profile markedly different from gateway states, one characterized

by humanitarian flows rather than economic migration chains connecting to traditional sending

regions.

Despite the demographic significance of international migration to small states and rural re-

gions, the empirical literature on state-level migration forecasting remains surprisingly thin. The

dominant paradigm in migration forecasting focuses on national-level flows, employing gravity mod-

els and time series methods calibrated to large-sample settings (Massey et al., 1993; Mayda, 2010).

When subnational analysis appears, it typically examines major receiving states—California, Texas,

Florida, New York—where sample sizes support conventional inferential approaches (Portes and

Rumbaut, 2006). Small states, characterized by volatile flows, limited historical observations, and

heightened sensitivity to policy shocks, have largely escaped systematic empirical scrutiny.

This lacuna reflects genuine methodological challenges. International migration to North Dakota
