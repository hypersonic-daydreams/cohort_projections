of baseline for at least two consecutive years. This procedure identifies 940 waves across 56 nation-

alities and 48 states in the 2002–2020 refugee data.

Kaplan-Meier estimation yields a median wave duration of 3.0 years (mean = 3.54 years).

Survival probabilities decline steadily over the wave lifecycle: 51.6% of waves survive past year 2;

31.8% survive past year 3; 21.6% survive past year 4; and only 6.2% survive past year 10. The

censoring rate of 10% reflects waves still active at the end of the observation period (FY 2020).

Stratified analysis reveals significant heterogeneity by wave intensity. Table 12 reports median

survival by intensity quartile.

Log-rank test: χ2 = 278.7, p < 10−60

Notes: Intensity = peak arrivals relative to baseline. Duration measured in years. Log-rank test evaluates
equality of survival curves across quartiles.

The log-rank test decisively rejects equality of survival curves across intensity quartiles (χ2 =

278.7, p < 10−60), confirming that higher-intensity waves persist substantially longer. The median

survival differential between Q1 and Q4—two years versus four years—indicates that wave duration

doubles at the upper extreme of initial intensity.

Regional origin also influences wave persistence. African (mean duration = 3.99 years), Middle

Eastern (4.14 years), and Asian (4.28 years) waves outlast those from Europe (2.40 years) and the

Americas (2.25 years). The log-rank test confirms significant regional heterogeneity (χ2 = 89.7,

p < 10−17).

Cox proportional hazards regression quantifies the multivariate relationship between wave char-

acteristics and termination risk. Key findings include:

 Log intensity: HR = 0.412 (p < 0.001). Higher-intensity waves exhibit 59% lower hazard

of termination, confirming the protective effect of initial magnitude.

 Early wave: HR = 1.361 (p < 0.001). Waves beginning in the early observation period

terminate faster, potentially reflecting data truncation or secular trends.

 Peak arrivals: HR = 0.656 (p < 0.001).
Higher peak arrivals during the wave reduce

termination hazard.

 Americas origin: HR = 1.711 (p = 0.005). Waves from the Americas terminate 71% faster

than the reference category (Africa).
