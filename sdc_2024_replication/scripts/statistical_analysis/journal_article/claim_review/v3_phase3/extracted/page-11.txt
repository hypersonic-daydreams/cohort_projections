Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota

unconcentrated distributions; values between 1,500 and 2,500 indicate moderate concentration;

values above 2,500 indicate high concentration. Location Quotients (LQ) measure the degree to

which North Dakota’s immigrant composition deviates from national patterns:

LQi,ND = (Foreign-born from i in ND)/(Total foreign-born in ND)

(Foreign-born from i in US)/(Total foreign-born in US)
(3)

Location quotients exceeding unity indicate overrepresentation of origin group i in North Dakota

relative to the nation.

Time Series Methods

Time series analysis characterizes the stochastic properties of international migration flows and

provides a foundation for forecasting. The analysis proceeds through four stages: unit root testing,

ARIMA model specification, structural break detection, and vector autoregression for multivariate

dynamics.

2.4.1
Unit Root Tests

Stationarity assessment employs ADF and PP tests alongside KPSS (null: stationarity) to triangu-

late integration properties in a very short series. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey

and Fuller, 1979) estimates the regression:

∆yt = α + βt + γyt−1 +

p
�

j=1
δj∆yt−j + εt
(4)

and tests H0 : γ = 0 (unit root) against H1 : γ < 0 (stationarity). Lag length p is selected by

the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Phillips-Perron (PP) test (Phillips and Perron, 1988)

provides a nonparametric alternative that corrects for serial correlation without augmenting the

regression. KPSS tests are run with a constant-only specification (level-stationarity). Break-robust

Zivot-Andrews tests (single endogenous break) are reported as sensitivity checks. Where tests yield

conflicting conclusions, the analysis reports both and interprets results cautiously.

2.4.2
ARIMA Model Selection

For series exhibiting unit roots, the analysis fits autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)

models of order (p, d, q), where d denotes the differencing order required for stationarity (Box and

Jenkins, 1970). Model selection employs the AIC criterion:

AIC = −2 ln(ˆL) + 2k
(5)

where ˆL denotes the maximized likelihood and k the number of parameters. Diagnostic checking

employs the Ljung-Box portmanteau test for residual autocorrelation and the Shapiro-Wilk test for
