Kaplan-Meier Curves: Immigration Wave Duration by Intensity

Overall
Q1 (Low) (n=247, med=2.0yr)
Q3 (n=236, med=3.0yr)
Q4 (High) (n=234, med=4.0yr)
Q2 (n=223, med=2.0yr)

Figure 8: Kaplan–Meier survival curves for immigration wave duration by initial intensity quartile.
Waves are defined as periods where arrivals exceed 50% above baseline for at least two consecutive
years. Q1 (lowest intensity) waves have median duration of 2 years, while Q4 (highest intensity)
waves persist for a median of 4 years. The log-rank test strongly rejects equality across groups
(χ2 = 278.7, p < 0.001), indicating that higher-intensity immigration flows are significantly more
persistent.
