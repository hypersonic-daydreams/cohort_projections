Autocorrelation Diagnostics for ND International Migration

Figure 4: Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for North
Dakota international migration series. Panels (A) and (B) show the level series, which exhibits slow
decay in the ACF consistent with nonstationarity. Panels (C) and (D) show the first-differenced
series, where autocorrelations fall within the 95% confidence bounds (dashed lines), supporting the
characterization of the series as I(1). Sample size n = 15.
