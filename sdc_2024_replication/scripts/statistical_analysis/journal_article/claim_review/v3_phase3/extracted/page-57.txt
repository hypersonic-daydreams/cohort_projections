Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota
57

Moderate.
For 2025–2029, the ARIMA point forecasts are used directly; from 2030 onward, the

trend is dampened to 50% of the averaged robust trend estimate.

Zero.
Net international migration is set to zero for all years.

Monte Carlo Uncertainty and Wave Simulation

The Monte Carlo simulation in Module 9 combines two sources of stochastic variation: (1) ARIMA

baseline uncertainty from the estimated random-walk process, and (2) wave duration draws from

the Cox proportional hazards model (Module 8). A potential concern is double-counting of refugee-

driven volatility, since the ARIMA model is trained on the full PEPnet migration series—which

includes historical refugee arrivals—while wave simulations add stochastic refugee wave contribu-

tions on top of this baseline.

We address this concern as follows. The wave simulation does not add independent refugee

variance; rather, it modulates the timing and persistence of above-baseline arrivals conditional on

an active wave being detected. Specifically:

1. The ARIMA baseline captures the unconditional mean and variance of the PEPseries, which

reflects average historical refugee influence.

2. The Cox-based wave simulation draws wave durations conditional on observed wave char-

acteristics (intensity, age, origin region) and applies a lifecycle shape function (initiation →

peak → decline) to allocate excess arrivals over time.

3. Wave contributions are defined as excess arrivals above the origin-specific baseline, not as

additive draws independent of the ARIMA process.

Nevertheless, because the ARIMA was not trained on a refugee-stripped series, some overlap

between baseline variance and wave-induced variance may remain. This design choice was made for

parsimony and because separating refugee from non-refugee components in PEPdata is infeasible

without auxiliary assumptions. Consequently, the Monte Carlo prediction intervals should be in-

terpreted as conservative (potentially inflated) rather than calibrated probability statements. This

limitation is acknowledged in Section 3.9, where we note that the 95% prediction interval spans a

factor of 4.1 by 2045.
