# Revised Draft Review Request

I'm submitting a revised version of "Forecasting International Migration to North Dakota: A Multi-Method Empirical Analysis."

## Previous Review

You previously reviewed this paper on December 29, 2025 and identified 11 major issues:

1. Clarify forecasting target/estimand
2. Module narrative integration
3. Small-sample inference reframing
4. Forecast backtesting validation
5. Gravity model specification
6. Causal inference robustness (DiD/SCM/Bartik)
7. Scenario arithmetic consistency
8. Duration analysis connection
9. Missing references/figures
10. ACS measurement error
11. Tone adjustments

## Revisions Made

Key changes addressing your critiques:

- Added "Estimand & Measurement" subsection with source mapping table
- Implemented rolling-origin backtesting with benchmark comparisons
- Added break-robust unit root tests (Zivot-Andrews)
- Re-estimated gravity model with clustered SEs, reframed as "diaspora associations"
- Re-estimated DiD/ITS with clustered SEs, added event study figure
- Reframed synthetic control as descriptive comparator
- Validated and corrected scenario arithmetic with appendix formulas
- Connected duration analysis to forecasting via wave registry
- Created pipeline overview diagram and module classification
- Applied terminology corrections (prediction intervals, hedged language)

## Request

Please review this revised draft and assess:

1. Which of the original 11 issues are now adequately addressed?
2. Which issues remain problematic and need further revision?
3. Any new issues introduced by the revisions?
4. Overall assessment: Is this closer to the "publishable with minor revisions" bar?
