## 1. Title: Wilson (2022) - North Dakota Migration
**Claim**: "North Dakota receives just 0.17% of national international migration flows."
**Prompt**:
```text
Does Wilson (2022) support the claim that "North Dakota receives just 0.17% of national international migration flows"? If the exact percentage isn't found, does it confirm low migration/gateway vs non-gateway disparity?
