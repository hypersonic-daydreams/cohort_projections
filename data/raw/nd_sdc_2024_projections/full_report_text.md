## Executive Summary

The North Dakota Department of Commerce – State Data Center prepared population projections for the state between now and 2050.

Between 2010 and 2020, the state has gained more than 106,000 residents, and reached a population count of 779,094 as of April 1, 2020. The state of North Dakota is projected to reach a population of 831,543 by 2030, a 6% increase; 890,424 by 2040, a 14% increase; and 957,124 by 2050, a 23% increase from Census 2020.

The growth the state experienced between 2010 and 2020 was the most significant in a century and is unlikely to be repeated in the near timeframe. In recent times, about half of the states in the U.S. have been in natural decline, experiencing more deaths than births. As a result, individuals are less likely to migrate for economic reasons, which has been a primary driver of North Dakota growth in the last decade.

Nationwide, the rate of childbirth has declined as mothers are having their first child at a later age and having fewer children than in the past. While the rate of births in North Dakota does remain higher than most states, it has experienced a gradual rate of decline over time. This trend is likely to continue in the future.

## Projected Statewide Population 2020 to 2050

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 2020 | 779,094 |
| 2025 | 796,989 |
| 2030 | 831,543 |
| 2035 | 865,397 |
| 2040 | 890,424 |
| 2045 | 925,101 |
| 2050 | 957,194 |

Urbanization and consolidation of the state's population into the state's metropolitan and micropolitan areas is likely to continue as has been the trend in the state for the last century. Most rural counties in the state are expected to continue to lose population to the more urban areas of the state. By 2050, nearly 30% of the state's population is expected to reside in just one county, (Cass County). Nearly 60% of the state's population will likely reside in the state's four largest counties.

The western areas of the state, which are dominated by energy developments and the boom to bust cycle that this region and the industry tends to experience, is less predictable than the eastern half of the state. Cass County, with its more balanced economic base, tends to be more predictable than much of the rest of the state.

### A Note of Caution

These projections are an attempt to provide the most likely outcome of population change expected in the state.

Past long-term projections have often been proven to be inaccurate. For example, the most recent Census Bureau state-level population projections completed in 2005 indicated the state of North Dakota would continuously lose population and would have approximately 606,000 individuals by 2030. At this point, these projections appear highly unlikely.

This office's 2018 projections put the expected Census 2020 resident count at 793,537, about 5,500 more than the 2020 decennial census found.

Fluctuation in prices of the state's exports will likely continue, as has been the case recently in both agricultural and mining sectors. It is impossible to forecast how these changes will play out or what impact they will have on the overall population of the state, regions, or counties over time. In addition, the oil boom in western North Dakota appears to have reversed a decades' long trend of out-migration. The pattern of migration that is believed to have occurred between 2010 and 2020 is likely to shift again with time. Given the dramatic shift in migration because of oil field development, the opportunity for these projections to be fallible must be considered.

The population of each county is summed to estimate the population of the region at years ending in a zero or a five. Likewise, the region's population is summed to that of the state for the same points in time.

---

## Methodology

The process used in these projections is a modified version of the cohort survival component method, the most used method of projections.

Projections are based upon the population by 5-year age group and sex found in each county in Census 2020. The natural rate of growth, rates of fertility and survival rates are determined for each age group and sex in each county, then mortality rates are applied.

### Fertility Data

Fertility, birth rates, and age of the mother was determined from data provided by North Dakota Department of Health & Human Services Vital Statistics from 2016 through 2022. Results by county were blended with both state level rates and those found nationally as of 2021 (National Vital Statistics Reports, 2023, January 31, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/index.htm), with rates smoothed to reduce anomalies in the number of births during this timeframe. (Children projected to be born to women who recently migrated to the state are treated as part of the net migration for each of the five-year periods.)

### Survival Rates

Survival rates are based upon the most recent life tables for state from the Center for Disease Control published in 2022 for the year 2020 (Center for Disease Control, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/index.htm).

### Migration

Migration is by far the most problematic and complex factor to predict but is probably the most important component of population change, as about three-fourths of the state's net population change between 2010 and 2020 is a result of migration.

To project the approximate rates of migration, the natural growth was calculated for each county by age group and sex for each five-year timeframe from 2000 to 2020. Timeframes include 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2010, 2010 to 2015, and 2015 to 2020. The differences found between what would be expected if there was no migration in each 5-year age group and 53 counties (1,908 individual cells) were then compared to estimate the past rate during this timeframe for each age group and sex in each county. An average of what was found for each age group in each sex was then averaged over the four 5-year timeframes to determine the expected percentage of the state's overall migration in each county, region, and the state.

Given the significant in-migration that North Dakota experienced from 2010 to 2020, the rates were typically reduced to about 60% of what was found using the process explained above because in-migration that occurred from 2010 to 2020 was the highest the state had experienced in a century because of the Bakken oil boom and is unlikely to occur again. Counties with significant college age populations typically required additional adjustments as the algorithm tends to not capture the in- and out-migration of college age residents as well as it should. The rate of migration in counties in the Bakken region that experienced significant growth during the last decade also were adjusted to a lower rate and the rate of male migration was further reduced compared to female migration as the pattern found from 2000 to 2020 when in-migration was dominated by males is unlikely to continue into the future and would have resulted in unrealistic sex ratio in future years.

## Components of Change

Population change is generally counted in two ways: natural growth (births minus deaths) and net migration. There is a high level of interaction between these two components as the age groups most likely to migrate are those of, or near, childbearing ages and young children. Natural growth is expected to gradually decline as rates of birth decline, reflecting a current trend in many other states. Migration is expected to continue to be a key factor in the state's population growth between now and 2050. Expected change in population by components of change is shown in the table below.

| Period | Natural Change | Net Migration | Total Expected Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 2020-2025 | 6,102 | 7,717 | 13,819 |
| 2025-2030 | 16,404 | 18,154 | 34,558 |
| 2030-2035 | 10,321 | 23,539 | 33,860 |
| 2035-2040 | 1,083 | 23,948 | 25,031 |
| 2040-2045 | 5,572 | 29,111 | 34,683 |
| 2045-2050 | (5,526) | 37,624 | 32,098 |

Natural growth is expected to initially be low up until 2025 due to some out-migration of individuals of childbearing ages in the first years of this decade, a trend that appears to be reversing now. Natural growth will again taper off later after 2045 in large part due to the larger population of older residents which will lead to a higher mortality rate and a trend towards lower fertility.

Net migration into the state will likely bring in approximately 140,000 additional residents between 2020 and 2050. An additional 34,000 will result from natural grow (births less deaths). As mentioned previously, in North Dakota, the natural rate is substantially influenced by migration as many of the state's new arrivals are primarily in the child-bearing age group.

Greater in-migration to the state by younger adults tends to be moderated by an outflow of retirement age adults. As a result, during times of higher migration, the state has experienced a downward shift in median age as younger residents often replace older residents. This phenomenon may be unique to this region. North Dakota is one of the few states with more males than females in large part due to its ability to attract workers into traditionally male dominated industries and females tend to exceed the number of males in the older age groups.

The rate of migration also will likely impact the sex ratio of the state. In 2020 there were 104 males for every 100 females in the state. The ratio of males to females should remain close to what was found in 2020 assuming the predicted migration pattern occurs. In a scenario where little migration occurs, the ratio of males to females would be close to even by 2050. Should there be more out-migration than in-migration the number of females would likely exceed the number of males in the state by 2050.

## Change in Population by Region

Both the eastern and western halves of the state will see growth. In the east, the Fargo region will see the greatest growth and the Grand Forks region will experience more limited growth. The Devils Lake and Jamestown regions are expected to see a gradual loss of population. The western four combined economic regions (Williston, Minot, Dickinson, and Bismarck) will continue to see growth through 2050.

### Expected Population Change 2020-2050 by Region

| Region | Change 2020-2050 |
|--------|------------------|
| Williston | +22,747 |
| Minot | +17,184 |
| Devils Lake | (3,310) |
| Grand Forks | +4,136 |
| Fargo | +86,340 |
| Jamestown | (6,614) |
| Bismarck | +36,853 |
| Dickinson | +20,765 |

The Fargo region will continue to have the highest percentage of the state population, dominated by Cass County, reaching nearly one-third of the state population by 2050. The Bismarck region will remain the second largest, dominated by the population of Burleigh and Morton counties remaining at about 21% of the state's total population.

Likewise, Cass County remains the largest county in terms of population. In 2015, Ward County was estimated to have briefly edged out Grand Forks County as the state's third largest county. These projections suggest that Ward will move ahead of Grand Forks around 2040 and continue to be the state's third largest county thereafter.

The Jamestown region is expected to remain under 56,000 individuals and experience a gradual loss of total population. The Devils Lake region is likely dropping below 35,000 by 2050. The Williston region is expected to reach a resident population of about 81,000 and the Dickinson region would have an expected population of approximately 70,000 by 2050.

## Changes in Demographic Makeup of the State Over Time

### Population of Children, Residents Under Age 18

The population of resident children continues to grow in the state. Child population will grow from about 153,000 to 228,000 by 2030, with growth slowing in the years reaching 2040.

### Young Children, Residents Under Age 5

The population of young children continues to grow through 2050, however at a slower rate than the state has experienced in the last few decades. This is due to the lower fertility rates and women having children at an older age.

### Workforce Age Group, Ages 18 – 64

The primary workforce age group is expected to grow continuously throughout the timeframe of the projections. Both those from 18 to 34 years of age as well as those 35 to 64 years of age should see continued growth through 2050.

### Age 65+ Residents

The population of age 65+ is expected to grow significantly between now and 2035, but decline slightly between 2035 and 2045, then begin to grow again. The 85+ age group is included in this projection.

### Age 85+ Residents

The 85+ population is expected to decline some between 2020 and 2025 due to a slightly smaller group entering this age range as well as some additional deaths due to COVID-19 but will begin to grow afterwards. The large number of individuals in the baby boom generation will cause this age group to grow substantially, particularly after 2040.
