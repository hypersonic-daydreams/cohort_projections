## Pre-2007 Data Availability (Research Notes)

**Research Date:** 2025-12-28

### Summary

County-level LPR data (lpr_state_county_*.xlsx format) is **NOT available before FY 2007**. The detailed county-by-country supplemental tables were first introduced in 2007.

### What IS Available for FY 2000-2006

The DHS/OHSS Yearbooks for 2000-2006 contain:

1. **State-level LPR totals** - Table 8 in most yearbooks shows "Immigrants admitted by state of intended residence"
2. **Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) data** - Table 9/10 shows top MSAs, but not county-level
3. **Country of birth tables** - National totals by country, not cross-tabulated with state
4. **Supplemental tables** - Available as ZIP files but contain state-level and MSA-level data only

**Key difference from 2007+:** Pre-2007 yearbooks provide state totals and MSA totals separately, but NOT the detailed county-by-country-by-state cross-tabulation that starts in 2007.

### Historical Documents Available

| Resource | URL | Coverage |
|----------|-----|----------|
| LPR Flow by State (1892-2010) | ohss.dhs.gov historical PDFs | State-level totals only |
| Yearbook 2000 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/yearbook-2000 | State + MSA tables |
| Yearbook 2001 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/yearbook-2001 | State + MSA tables |
| Yearbook 2002 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/2002 | State + MSA tables |
| Yearbook 2003 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/2003 | State + MSA tables |
| Yearbook 2004 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/2004 | State + MSA tables |
| Yearbook 2005 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/2005 | State + MSA + Supplemental tables |
| Yearbook 2006 | ohss.dhs.gov/yearbook/2006 | State + MSA + Supplemental tables |

### Access Notes

- Programmatic downloads from OHSS/DHS websites are blocked by CDN
- Files must be downloaded manually through a web browser
- ZIP files contain Excel (XLS) and some PDF tables
- Earlier yearbooks (1996-1999) available but with less detail
- **2026-01-04 update:** `curl -I -L` to `LPR2006_0.zip` returned HTTP 403 (Akamai); manual browser download required (completed for FY 2000-2006).
- **2026-01-04 update:** Manual browser downloads completed for FY 2007-2013 LPR yearbook ZIPs and tables; files staged in this directory.
- **2026-01-04 update:** FY2012 main ZIP unavailable; state totals extracted from the yearbook PDF.

### Recommendations

1. **For trend analysis:** Use historical yearbook state-level tables (manually extracted) for FY 2000-2006
2. **For country-of-origin trends:** National-level country data is available back to 1820
3. **For MSA analysis:** Top 10-20 MSAs available in pre-2007 yearbooks
4. **County-level analysis must start FY 2007** - this is the earliest year with county-by-country data
