  # Transparency/opacity rules:
  # - All colors may be used with transparency (alpha) values
  # - Transparency must be in 10% increments: 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%
  # - In matplotlib: use alpha parameter (1.0, 0.9, 0.8, etc.)
  # - In hex with alpha: append two digits (FF=100%, E6=90%, CC=80%, B3=70%, 99=60%, 80=50%, 66=40%, 4D=30%, 33=20%, 1A=10%)
